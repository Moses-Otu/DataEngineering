# Case Study: Machine Learning for Predicting Trainee Success

Your company hires over 1,000 graduate trainees each year and seeks to improve its selection process using machine learning to predict which candidates are most likely to succeed in specific roles or the organization as a whole.

## Objective

Your task is to design a machine learning model that predicts trainee success with a certain level of accuracy (x%).

### Key Questions:
1. **How would you define "success" for a trainee in your organization?**
2. **What metrics would you use to measure success?**

## Data Collection

You have access to historical data from past trainees, including:
- Academic performance (e.g., GPA)
- Interview scores
- Personality assessments
- Work experience
- On-the-job performance appraisals (KPIs, promotion rate, retention)

### Additional Considerations:
1. **What additional data points might improve the accuracy of the prediction?**
2. **How would you handle missing or incomplete data?**

## Model Building

Using the available data, build a machine learning model.

### Key Questions:
1. **Which machine learning algorithms would you consider using for this problem, and why?**
2. **How would you ensure the model's accuracy and fairness in predicting success for all candidates?**

## Implementation

Once the model is trained and validated:

### Key Questions:
1. **How would you integrate this predictive model into your organization's recruitment process?**
2. **What challenges might you face when using this model, and how would you address them?**

## Evaluation

After implementing the model, it's important to regularly assess its performance to ensure it continues to provide accurate predictions.

### Key Questions:
1. **How would you assess the model's performance over time?**
2. **What methods would you use to ensure the model remains accurate and fair?**
