Africa,Politics,‘We need our bananas back’: Traders left in limbo amid Malawi-Tanzania spat,"Lilongwe, Malawi – Since he was young, Enock Dayton has made a living from bananas. The 30-year-old was born and raised in Molele, in the southern Malawian district of Thyolo, which was at the heart of local banana production until a plant virus devastated crops more than a decade ago.
At his stall at Mchesi market, in Malawi’s capital Lilongwe, Dayton serves customers from the bunches of green bananas that he has. “I started this business when I was young, and we had farms where we were growing bananas and we would take trucks and bring them here and sell them to individuals,” he told Al Jazeera.
But in 2013, the deadly banana bunchy top disease wiped out almost all the crops in the country. Farmers were asked to uproot their banana plants to avoid the spread of the virus; hundreds of thousands of people were affected.
Bananas are Malawi’s fourth biggest staple crop, after maize, rice and cassava, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
The United Nations body – which is working with other organisations to help revive banana farming in the country – said in 2023 that with “the right investments and strategic support, the banana sector has the potential to provide greater benefits in food and nutrition security and commercial value for growers, transporters, consumers and food processors”.
But in the meantime, to maintain their businesses in the absence of sufficient local produce, farmers and fruit-sellers like Dayton turned to neighbouring Tanzania to import the crop and complement their own meagre local supplies. In 2023 alone, for instance, Malawi imported more than $491,000 worth of bananas, with the majority of that – 5,564,180kg (12,266,920lb) – coming primarily from Tanzania. The remainder came from South Africa and Mozambique.
But this year, that arrangement came to a sudden halt. In March, Malawi said it was temporarily banning the import of some farm produce, including bananas, from Tanzania and other countries. The government said this was to help support local industries and stabilise the country’s foreign exchange shortage, which has led to challenges that include the inability to import some necessities, like pharmaceuticals.
But Malawi might have underestimated the effect of its bold move, observers say.
In retaliation, in April, Tanzania banned the entry of all agricultural imports from Malawi, responding to what it described as restrictions on some of its exports. That ban also extended to South Africa, which for years prohibited the entry of bananas from Tanzania.
This was bad news for Malawi, observers say, as it is more on the receiving end of trade between the neighbours. According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Malawi exports less than $50m worth of products to Tanzania, including soybean meal, soybeans and dried legumes, while it imports hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of mineral fuels, oil, distilled products, soaps, lubricants, cement and glassware, among other products.
In its response, Dar es Salaam went a step further, extending its trade ban to the export of fertiliser from Tanzania to landlocked Malawi. It also threatened to stop goods en route to Malawi from passing through Tanzania.
By land, Malawi depends on Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique for the import of goods. As it lacks direct access to the sea, Malawi utilises seaports in Tanzania and Mozambique. But the instability of the Mozambique route – due to insecurity caused by conflict, recent post-election violence and truck drivers facing harassment – made the deadlock with Tanzania a bigger challenge for industry. Businesses that rely on the import of farm produce started crying foul as their trucks of groundnuts and other produce stood in line at the Songwe border.
Malawi also found itself in a tricky situation as it depends on Tanzania for its harbours to import fuel.
Soon, even Kenya found itself entangled in the conflict as cargo from Malawi, which has to travel through Tanzania, was also stopped en route.
The ensuing row shone a light on Malawi’s precarious geographical location, as well as regional agreements aimed at facilitating trade, the efforts by individual nations to follow the rules, and the macroeconomic imbalances in a nation designated as one of the poorest in the world.
After weeks of tensions, this month, a high-level meeting between Malawi and Tanzania appeared to have brokered the differences, paving the way for the lifting of the bans between the two countries, according to a spokesperson for Malawi’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
For Ernest Thindwa, a political commentator based at the University of Malawi, the recent trade dispute does not exist in isolation – and should also be viewed from a political lens.
Both countries are heading for polls this year, first Malawi in September and then Tanzania in November. Within an election environment, the dispute says something about the attempts by both countries’ leaders to display patriotism and a sense of empowerment to their citizens, the analyst said.
“The current administration [in Malawi] wants to be seen to be delivering and they want to be seen to be responding to people’s concerns,” Thindwa told Al Jazeera. “And certainly they need to make sure that local producers are protected, which has become more urgent as we go towards elections.”
Thindwa said that both Malawi and Tanzania are signatories to regional and international trade agreements, the frameworks of which entitle them to take measures to protect their trade interests when they deem necessary.
However, he questioned the timing of these moves, asking why the initiatives by Malawi were not implemented earlier if they were indeed to protect local industries.
Answering his own question, he said, “Because then it might have not been an agent in terms of attracting votes.”
“What you would call subsistence or smallholder producers … would be significant for the government in terms of trying to win votes from such social groups,” he observed.
Meanwhile, in Tanzania, something similar was at play in its decision to retaliate, Thindwa said.
“The incumbent administration in Tanzania wants to be seen to be responding to the needs and interests of its citizens. So the administration in that country, in Tanzania, also wanted to project an image that it cares for its people. That’s why it responded rather quickly.”
Broadly speaking, Thindwa noted that the trade dispute points to overall challenges African countries face – in terms of promoting internal trade, and trading more within Africa than with other continents.
Citing the example of Angola, he said that despite it having oil, countries within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) bloc continue to import oil from the Middle East.
“There is Angola there,” he said. “Why can’t they put together a regional project, for instance, and invest in the capabilities to make sure that the end product is being produced in Angola and Angola serves the region, to be much cheaper for the region? And it will make sure that the resources of the region remain within the region.”
Such examples show that “in spite of these trade protocols, Africa still struggles to encourage trade between member states”, he said.
“So the case of Tanzania and Malawi is just a symptom of a huge challenge Africa faces in terms of promoting internal trade.”
In a statement on May 9, Malawi’s Ministry of Trade said Malawi and Tanzania had held bilateral discussions in Tanzania regarding the implementation and resolution of its prohibition order.
After that, a letter from the ministry, addressed to Malawi’s Revenue Authority, read: “In this regard, I wish to advise that you facilitate the clearance of exports and imports of goods between the Republic of Malawi and the Republic of Tanzania. This, however, does not exempt importers from complying with legal and regulatory requirements, including obtaining the relevant licences and certifications from regulatory bodies.”
After the talks, Charles Nkhalamba, Malawi’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, told Al Jazeera the neighbours had signed “a joint communique” to resolve the dispute between them.
The “high-level discussions” were a result of “robust diplomatic efforts” by the foreign ministries of both countries, he said in a message on WhatsApp, adding that Tanzania also “acknowledg[ed] the economic circumstances that necessitated the import restrictions”.
During the meeting, both parties agreed in principle on the importance of continuous engagement and communication on all matters impacting their bilateral trade relations, Nkhalamba added.
Weeks earlier, Tanzania’s Ministry of Agriculture also released a statement acknowledging that Lilongwe had reached out to Dar es Salaam to resolve the problem and stating that “Tanzania is lifting a ban on export and import of agricultural produce to and from Malawi”.
In principle, the trade war between the neighbours appears to have stalled for now.
But experts told Al Jazeera that practically speaking, it will take time for the logistics to be sorted out and for things to return to normal for sellers left in limbo when their supplies dried up.
At the market in Lilongwe, Dayton is eagerly awaiting the trucks of sweet bananas from across the border, so he has enough to sell to his customers.
He is grateful for the cross-border trade, and the arrangement that has over the years helped business people like him make money selling the crop from their neighbours.
But he also had mixed feelings as he reminisced about their lost opportunity to grow their own crops.
“The amount of money we used to have when we grew our own bananas is different from what we’re earning now,” Dayton said. “While we were growing and buying them at a cheap price … we were making a lot of money, apart from the transport [costs]. The ones from Tanzania are quite expensive.
“We need our bananas back.”
A decade ago, Dayton was a casualty of a natural disaster that made his garden back in the village dormant. Now, he feels that he is a casualty of the decisions made by authorities in offices far away.
“What we want is a stable supply of bananas in this market,” he said. “It’s good because it provides for our families and the customers as well.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/14/we-need-our-bananas-back-traders-left-in-limbo-amid-malawi-tanzania-spat
Africa,Uncategorized,Mali dissolves all political parties after opposition figures ‘arrested’,"Mali’s military government has dissolved all political parties after accusations from rights groups that opposition figures have been arrested.
Assimi Goita, who seized power in two army coups in 2020 and 2021, validated the decision after it was broadcast to Malians in a televised statement on Tuesday.
The parties were disbanded after demonstrations this month, demanding the country returned to democratic rule.
Protesters gathered on May 3 and 4, carrying placards with slogans reading, “Down with dictatorship, long live democracy,” in a rare public rebuke of the military government, which had promised to hold elections in 2022.
A national conference held in April recommended extending Goita’s presidency until 2030, drawing condemnation from opposition figures and human rights groups.
In response to another protest that had been planned on Friday, the military government issued a decree suspending all political activities across the country.
The move forced opposition groups to cancel the demonstration, and the government has now tightened its grip further.
The clampdown has coincided with reports of disappearances of opposition figures. Human rights groups said several politicians have been forcibly disappeared in recent days.
On Thursday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Abba Alhassane, the secretary-general of the Convergence for the Development of Mali (CODEM), was “arrested” by “masked gunmen”.
That same day, El Bachir Thiam, the leader of the Yelema party, was reportedly seized by unidentified men in Kati, a town outside the capital.
On Tuesday, a CODEM member speaking on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency that the party had lost contact with Abdoul Karim Traore, a youth leader, and feared he too had been abducted.
Malian authorities have not commented on the reported arrests.
Goita first seized power in August 2020 amid escalating attacks from armed groups affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda’s regional affiliate Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM).
In July 2020, protests against the former civilian government were violently repressed with at least 14 people killed during a crackdown by security forces.
The military then ousted the elected government, citing its failure to tackle the armed groups.
In December last year, HRW reported that Malian soldiers alongside Russian Wagner Group fighters “deliberately killed” at least 32 civilians and burned more than 100 homes in central and northern Mali.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/mali-dissolves-all-political-parties-after-opposition-figures-arrested
Africa,Politics,Why has Trump given white South Africans refugee status?,"On Monday, 59 white South Africans arrived in the United States as part of a refugee programme set up by President Donald Trump to offer sanctuary from what Washington has described as racial discrimination against Afrikaners.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration offered to resettle Afrikaners, descendants of European colonial settlers in South Africa, stating that they face harassment and violence in their country. At the same time, he froze aid to the African nation.
As the group arrived at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told them: “I want you all to know that you are really welcome here and that we respect what you have had to deal with these last few years.
“We respect the long tradition of your people and what you have accomplished over the years,” he said.
In a news conference on Monday, Trump doubled down on claims that white people have been subjected to systematic violence since the end of apartheid, or white minority rule, in South Africa.
The Afrikaner community are descendents of mainly Dutch settlers who established apartheid in 1948. Under apartheid, whites could seize land and resources from the Black population, who were relegated to “Bantustans” or overcrowded townships.
Although apartheid ended in 1994 – when the African National Congress won the first racially inclusive democratic election in South Africa – most commentators agree that racism persists today, with many Black people still disproportionately lacking access to land, resources and opportunities.
In January, President Cyril Ramaphosa introduced a new law seeking to address land ownership disparities – which have left three-quarters of privately owned land in South Africa in the hands of the white minority – by making it easier for the state to expropriate land.
Ramaphosa has insisted that the law does not amount to land confiscation, but creates a framework for fair redistribution by allowing authorities to take land in the public interest without compensation only in exceptional circumstances, like when the area is abandoned.
Shortly after the introduction of the Expropriation Act, Trump wrote on his Truth Social account: “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY… the United States won’t stand for it, we will act.”
Washington has said it agreed to grant Afrikaners refugee status after the introduction of the law.
Trump is also at odds with the African nation’s prominent position in the International Court of Justice’s case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.
“It’s a genocide that’s taking place,” Trump told reporters at the White House, a claim that has drawn criticism from South African officials and the international media.
Trump’s claim echoes white nationalist beliefs that South Africa’s legislation aimed at rectifying apartheid is now, in fact, discriminatory against the Afrikaner community.
Right-wing organisations, such as the Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum, have been championing a narrative that Afrikaners are under an existential threat.
Elon Musk, the South African-born tech billionaire and a close ally of Trump, is perceived by many as an ally of the Afrikaner cause.
He has repeatedly posted his outrage on X against what he claims is unfair treatment of white South Africans – even going as far as claiming a “white genocide” was occurring.
Still, South African whites own most of the country’s private land and have about 20 times more wealth than Blacks on average. In corporate South Africa, white individuals occupy 62 percent of top management positions while 17 percent of leadership roles are held by Black managers.
And even statistics provided by AfriForum and the Transvaal Agricultural Union – also a group sympathetic to white farmers – show that the total number of farmers, across all races, killed every year numbers about 60. This is a country that sees 19,000 murders in all, annually.
Some younger Afrikaners have taken to social media to mock the asylum offer, posting parody videos that highlight the privileges white people enjoy in South Africa today.
In March, the South African government called Trump’s claims that Afrikaners face persecution “completely false”, noting they have remained among the richest and “most economically privileged” groups.
On Monday, President Ramaphosa told an Africa CEO Forum in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, that “we think that the American government has got the wrong end of the stick here, but we’ll continue talking to them.”
Ramaphosa said he had spoken to Trump about the issue.
The South African president said the far-right Afrikaners seeking refugee status were a “fringe grouping”, adding that they are “anti-transformation and anti-change [and] would actually prefer South Africa to go back to apartheid-type policies. I said to him [Trump] that I would never do that.”
Ramaphosa also revealed that he is set to meet with Trump soon regarding the issue.
Tensions between the Trump administration and the government of South Africa are high, with the US expelling South Africa’s ambassador in March due to criticisms of Trump.
The Trump administration is also at odds with Pretoria’s prominent position in the International Court of Justice’s case against Israel, which stands accused of genocide in Gaza.
Another major flashpoint was the abrupt pause in US aid funding in January and the dismantling of USAID operations in South Africa. This particularly affected the PEPFAR program, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.
In 2023 alone, South Africa received roughly $460m in PEPFAR funds, covering nearly 18 percent of the country’s total HIV/AIDS budget. The funding freeze is jeopardising efforts to combat one of the world’s most severe HIV epidemics.
Trade diplomacy has not escaped the fallout, either. With a proposed 30 percent tariff rate, South Africa was among the hardest hit by Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs on April 2, which disproportionately affected some African nations. Only five other countries faced steeper trade hikes than South Africa.
Although a 90-day pause was granted before the tariffs’ implementation, the looming threat of higher trade levies – especially on car exports – has created deep anxiety in Pretoria.
Yesterday’s arrival of dozens of Afrikaners into the US comes as the Trump administration blocks nearly all other refugee admissions and leans into rhetoric about an “invasion” of immigrants from poorer nations.
Speaking from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera correspondent Patty Culhane said the Trump administration “has made a priority of getting these people [white South Africans] into the United States”.

Africa,Politics,Ivory Coast opposition leader resigns but vows to still fight for victory,"Ivory Coast’s main opposition leader has said he is resigning as party leader but would still lead the fight to win the election, after having been barred from standing in an October presidential vote.
“In the interest of the party, I’ve decided to place my mandate as president of the party in your hands, the activists,” Thiam said in a speech published on social media on Monday.
“This decision does not change the commitment I made in December 2023 to personally lead our party to victory in October 2025.”
President Alassane Ouattara, 83, who has been in power since 2011, has yet to say whether he plans to run again but has said he is eager to “continue serving my country”.
Tidjane Thiam’s campaign for the presidency of the West African country has been mired in tussles over his nationality, as presidential candidates are not allowed to hold dual citizenship.
Thiam was born in the Ivory Coast and renounced his French passport in March to enable his run for the top job. However, a court in Abidjan struck him off the electoral list last month, saying the 62-year-old politician had lost Ivorian nationality when he acquired French citizenship in 1987.
Thiam also faces a legal case against his election as head of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast–African Democratic Rally (PDCI) after a party member also contested his Ivorian nationality at the time he was chosen.
PDCI deputy president Ernest N’Koumo Mobio assumed the party’s interim leadership following Thiam’s announcement. He appealed for “cohesion, serenity and discipline” and called a party meeting early Monday due to “the urgency linked to the political situation”.
Three other opposition figures have also been excluded from the presidential race, including former President Laurent Gbagbo due to court convictions.
Thiam alleged irregularities on Monday. “While we had the right to hope for inclusive, transparent and peaceful elections, it is clear that the unjustified removal of the PDCI candidate is part of the logic of eliminating the leaders of the main opposition parties to ensure tailor-made elections and a certain victory,” he said.
The authorities regularly reject claims of any political intervention in the electoral process, saying decisions are taken by an independent judiciary.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/12/ivory-coast-opposition-leader-resigns-but-vows-to-still-fight-for-victory
Africa,Politics,"Burkina Faso army, militias killed 130 members of ethnic group, HRW says","At least 130 civilians belonging to the Fulani ethnic group were killed by Burkina Faso’s army and allied militias near the western town of Solenzo in March, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said.
The killings took place amid a major weeks-long military campaign by special forces that resulted in “widespread civilian deaths and massive displacement” of the Fulani pastoralist community in the region, the rights group said in a report on Monday.
It added that an Al-Qaeda-affiliated group called the Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) then carried out a series of retaliatory attacks, hitting villages that the armed group perceived as having assisted the military.
Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at HRW, said in a statement the “the viral videos of the atrocities by pro-government militias near Solenzo” that cirinitially circulated “told only part of the story”.
“Further research uncovered that Burkina Faso’s military was responsible for these mass killings of Fulani civilians, which were followed by deadly reprisals by an Islamist armed group,” Allegrozzi added.
“The government needs to impartially investigate these deaths and prosecute all those responsible.”
HRW had reported in March that the government’s involvement was likely due to video evidence online.
At that time, the government strongly denied the allegations, saying in a statement it “condemned the propagation, on social media, of images inducing hate and community violence, and fake information aimed at undermining social cohesion” in the West African country.
Burkina Faso’s government and army did not immediately react to Monday’s report, which alleged that the Burkinabe army “led and participated in the massacre of more than 130, possibly many more, ethnic Fulani civilians by pro-government militias”.
The rights organisation’s report is based on interviews with witnesses to the attacks, militia members, journalists and civil society members.
Witnesses quoted by HRW said hundreds of government troops and drones, as well as a pro-government militia called the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDP), were involved in attacks on Solenzo and other towns in the western Boucle du Mouhoun region.
The witnesses said most of the victims in Banwa province were women, children and older people.
Military helicopters and drones surveilled the area, “indicating direct command control of the operation”, HRW said.
A 44-year-old Fulani herder, who lost eight family members, told HRW that thousands of families from more than 20 villages were forced to flee to neighbouring Mali in search of protection.
“However, we couldn’t reach Mali without crossing villages [that were] occupied by the VDPs and the army. The VDPs shot at us like animals, while drones were flying over our heads. Many women and children died because they could not run,” he said.
Military rulers took power in Burkina Faso in 2022, but they have largely failed to provide the stability promised, as more than 60 percent of the country is estimated to be outside government control.
The military has also turned to mass recruitment of civilians who are deployed in poorly trained militia units, leading to worsening tensions between ethnic groups.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/12/burkina-faso-army-militias-killed-130-members-of-ethnic-group-hrw-says
Africa,Climate,"More than 100 dead after flooding in eastern DR Congo, officials say","Heavy overnight floods have washed away several villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, killing more than 100 people, according to local officials, in a nation suffering war and mass displacement.
The floods were triggered by torrential rains and surged through the Kasaba village, in South Kivu province, during the night of Thursday into Friday, regional official Bernard Akili told news agency AFP on Saturday.
Torrential rains caused the Kasaba River to burst its banks overnight, with the rushing waters “carrying everything in their path, large stones, large trees and mud, before razing the houses on the edge of the lake”, he said.
“The victims who died are mainly children and elderly,” he said, adding that 28 people were injured and some 150 homes were destroyed.
Sammy Kalonji, the regional administrator, said the torrent killed at least 104 people and caused “enormous material damage.”
South Kivu’s provincial health minister, Theophile Walulika Muzaliwa, told the Associated Press news agency that rescue operations were hampered by a lack of services and a shutdown of telephone lines due to the flooding.
“Sector chiefs, village chiefs and locality chiefs, who are also members of the local government, are on site. The only humanitarian organisation currently present is the Red Cross,” he said.
A local resident told AFP that some 119 bodies had been found by Saturday.
Such natural disasters are frequent in DR Congo, particularly on the shores of the Great Lakes in the east of the country, as the surrounding hills are weakened by deforestation. In 2023, floods killed 400 people in several communities located on the shores of Lake Kivu, in South Kivu province, while last month, 33 people were killed in flooding in the capital, Kinshasa.
DR Congo has also been subject to decades of fighting between government troops and rebels in the eastern part of the country, which escalated in late January when the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu state, in a rapid and surprise offensive.
Nearly 3,000 people were killed and 2,880 injured in the Goma offensive, worsening what is already considered one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people remaining displaced.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/11/more-than-100-dead-after-flooding-in-eastern-dr-congo-officials-say

The regional administration spokesperson, Abdinasir Hirsi Idle, said on Saturday that rescue efforts were continuing.
“The death toll could rise because the rains were heavy and lasted for several hours, causing nine houses to collapse across different neighbourhoods, and at least six major roads to suffer severe damage,” he said.
Somalia has in the past suffered extreme climate shocks, including prolonged dry seasons that have caused droughts and heavy rains resulting in floods.
Friday’s rains went on for about eight hours, leaving waist-high waters in neighbourhoods where some residents were trapped and others were forced to move to higher ground.
A resident, Mohamed Hassan, told The Associated Press news agency that some older people were still trapped.
“We spent the night on rooftops, shivering from the cold, and I haven’t even had breakfast,” he said.
Floodwaters also damaged key infrastructure, halting public transport and temporarily disrupting operations at the main Aden Abdulle airport. Officials later confirmed flights had resumed.
The Somalia Disaster Management Agency has not yet released an official death toll, but it said the assessment was under way to determine the extent of the damage.
The country’s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources said in a statement on Saturday that “a substantial amount of rainfall, exceeding 115mm, was recorded in over 8 consecutive hours” and warned of flash floods in other regions outside the capital.",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/5/11/heavy-rains-cause-flooding-in-somali-capital-killing-seven

Africa,Uncategorized,Gunmen kill 30 during ‘vicious’ attack in southeast Nigeria: Rights group,"At least 30 people were killed when gunmen attacked travellers in Nigeria’s southeastern Imo State, according to Amnesty International.
The human rights NGO reported on Friday that more than 20 commuter vehicles and trucks were set ablaze during a “vicious attack” along the Okigwe-Owerri road the day before.
The attackers are suspected of being members of the banned separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Amnesty said.
“​​The attack … shows callous disregard for the sanctity of life. The gunmen blocked Okigwe-Owerri highway and areas of Umuna in Onuimo LGA unleashed violence in an utter show of impunity,” Amnesty wrote on X.
“The Nigerian authorities must immediately and transparently investigate this attack and ensure that the actual perpetrators are brought to justice. International law requires the Nigerian government to promptly investigate unlawful killings to bring perpetrators to justice,” it added.
Amnesty International strongly condemns the vicious attack on travelers yesterday 8 May 2025, along Okigwe-Owerri Road in Imo State, killing at least 30 people and burning over 20 commuter vehicles and trucks.
— Amnesty International Nigeria (@AmnestyNigeria) May 9, 2025
Imo police spokesperson, Henry Okoye, confirmed that the attack took place in the early hours of Thursday, but declined to comment on the death toll.
On Friday, Okoye told the Reuters news agency that one of the assailants had been killed by the police.
According to a police statement, the gunmen, operating in three groups, blocked the highway at 04:00 GMT and shot sporadically.
“A full-scale search and cordon operation is currently underway, with security operatives combing nearby forests and surrounding areas where the suspects are believed to be hiding,” the police said.
Nigeria’s Premium Times also reported that the police commissioner of Imo State, Aboki Danjuma, led a joint tactical team of security operatives to the scene.
According to Danjuma, the joint security team comprised personnel from Nigeria’s army, the police, and the State Security Service.
The IPOB, which the Nigerian government has classed as an outlawed organisation, has been campaigning for the secession of southeastern Nigeria, where the majority of people belong to the Igbo ethnic group.

Africa,Politics,‘A step too far’: Malians protest military gov’t moves to hold on to power,"When Mali’s Colonel Assimi Goita first seized power in a coup in 2020, the West African nation erupted in joy. His promises to hold elections and bring stability to parts of the country troubled by armed groups were tantalising for a nation under siege.
Nearly five years later, however, Goita has repeatedly reneged on those promises. The security situation has only marginally improved, with violence and killings – sometimes by government forces – reported regularly in areas outside the capital, Bamako, while elections have been postponed.
Somehow, popular support for Goita has largely held – until now.
Public anger at the military government was evident on May 3 when hundreds of people gathered in Bamako with defiant fists raised in protest. The demonstrations – a visible first against the military – came after government officials “proposed” at a national conference last week that Goita lead the country until 2030 and that political parties be dissolved.
On Wednesday, the government suspended political parties “until further notice for reasons of public order”, before mass protests slated for Friday.
The rare revolts signal a reawakening by Malians, whose popular protests against previous rulers built the vacuum that allowed the military to seize power. Many had promised to return to the streets if the regime held on to power indefinitely.
“For many people, even those who supported the government at first, this is a step too far,” Ousmane Diallo, Sahel researcher at Amnesty International, told Al Jazeera. “They see it as Goita trying to consolidate and hold on to power, and they have resolved to stand against it.”
The protests almost turned into an all-out brawl at the central Cultural Palace in downtown Bamako, as pro-transition youth armed with green-, gold-, and red-coloured Malian flags launched counter-rallies. Violence might not be far off, Diallo said, as more Malians are likely to react to the military government’s decrees. In July 2020, protests against the previous government were met with violent crackdowns by security forces, and at least 14 people were killed.
“There’s a real backlash now, and things could get more heated, especially if factions of the military decide to ally with the streets,” Diallo said, referring to possible mutinies within the army.
Goita’s coup in August 2020 came during a wave of mass antigovernment protests in Bamako because of advancing swarms of armed groups from the north. The groups – which are still active and aim to build caliphates – rendered huge swaths of the country ungovernable, sacking villages, killing civilians and displacing hundreds. ISIL affiliate in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and al-Qaeda-linked Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) are two of the most active ones.
At the time, Malians blamed the civilian government for failing to deal with the threat. This despite assistance from a United Nations peacekeeping mission and former colonial power France, both of which had deployed more than 15,000 soldiers in northern Mali. So when young soldiers appeared on state television and declared a coup, most were in support.
Goita, 36 at the time, struck a visionary image with his promises of elections and peace. He installed a civilian-led transition government, while he stayed on as vice president. Under pressure from the regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to hold elections, Goita presented a transition charter spelling out that the military vice president could in no case be president, and that elections would be held in 18 months.
Signs that he would go back on his word came early, however. Goita staged another coup in May 2021, kicking out the civilian president and installing himself as leader. Then, in 2022, when the transition was meant to expire, the military rulers postponed elections and instead presented a five-year transition plan. ECOWAS, which had initially suspended the country, refused the deal. Opposition political parties protested in statements, but the military government has not changed track.
Meanwhile, several opposition politicians have been arrested, tried, and sentenced on charges such as taking part in an “unauthorised demonstration” or “opposition to legitimate authority” since Goita took power. Last July, the government suspended political parties and banned media coverage of “all political activities” for three months.
Analysts say even if Goita were to step down now and hold elections as initially promised, extensive damage to the country’s democratic institutions has already set in during his five-year term.
Mali, along with neighbouring militart-led Burkina Faso and Niger, defied ECOWAS sanctions for failing to hold elections, and have since left the regional group. Together, they’ve formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES). The military leaders in Burkina Faso and Niger have already extended their rule by five years.
“The damage is not irreversible, but it’s going to be very difficult to get back on track [for elections] because things have gone very far from what was initially promised,” Diallo said.
One reason why Goita has enjoyed popular support thus far, analysts say, is because of recent gains recorded over armed groups and a secessionist coalition in the north.
Many people are also happy that Bamako has distanced itself from France, a former colonial power increasingly disliked across Francophone West Africa for what some see as its exploitative business interests. Some of the biggest French-owned companies in Mali include oil company Total and telecoms provider Orange.
French troops exited Mali in 2022 because Paris refused to back the military government. Bamako has since cut diplomatic ties and sent UN peacekeepers packing. In their place are Russian fighters from the Wagner mercenary group, known for their ruggedness and reported ruthlessness towards civilians.
Ulf Laessing, director of Sahel research at Germany-based think tank, Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, told Al Jazeera that while Russian fighters have helped stabilise parts of the north, the victory is far from complete as the armed groups have simply spread out into central and southern Mali.
“The capital is safe and parts of the north, but outside that, it’s still difficult,”  Laessing said. “In areas like [northern] Timbuktu, government control is still very weak, and the Russians haven’t been able to make a difference to that. There are only about 1,500 of them when even the French were 5,000.”
Although they have suffered deadly ambushes, Wagner fighters helped secure the military’s biggest win in 2023 when Kidal, a rebel stronghold in the north, fell under government control for the first time in 10 years.
Back in 2012, Tuareg rebel groups who were fighting for an independent Azawad state seized Kidal and declared independence. They involved armed groups like JNIM, which later took over the campaign and spread into neighbouring countries, contributing to the current security crisis.
In 2015, a UN-mediated peace agreement with the secessionists was meant to see Tuareg fighters integrate into the army and Kidal return to government control. However, it was never implemented. Goita has since cancelled the agreement, pledging to restore all of Mali’s “territorial integrity”.
When Kidal fell in August 2023, it was both a tactical and symbolic win for the military. Goita’s supporters cite that as one example of why the strongman should stay on to secure the entire country. However, opponents say that argument is a pretext for the military leaders to stay in power for longer.
The military’s relative gains have also come at a cost for civilians, rights groups say. Russian fighters and Malian soldiers have been accused in numerous reports of extrajudicial killings of suspected “militants”, some of whom are wrongly profiled.
Ethnic groups like the Fulani and Dogon – perceived by the Malian army to be supporting armed groups – have been targeted in particular. In reality, experts say villagers themselves are often controlled against their will by powerful armed groups that have set up their own tax and judicial systems. There are reports of armed groups forcibly recruiting men from villages they occupy, while others join armed groups to avenge military attacks on their homes, experts say.
In December, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that the Malian army and Wagner fighters “deliberately killed” at least 32 civilians and burned 100 homes in central and northern Mali in 2024. JNIM and ISGS summarily executed at least 47 civilians, burned more than 1,000 homes, and displaced thousands of people between June and December alone, HRW said, adding that those numbers were conservative, at best.
Since Kidal fell, ethnic Tuareg have also been met with increasing levels of violence from the military, although it initially promised that civilians would be safe. Hundreds of people have fled into neighbouring Mauritania, dreading Wagner fighters or the “white men with masks” who burn homes and execute those they suspect of being rebel fighters, according to reporting by The Washington Post.
Some 3.3 million people are now believed to be displaced across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger due to the violence, according to the UN’s refugee agency. The number of newly displaced people last year in Mali alone reached nearly 400,000.
As the political climate in Bamako becomes more restrictive, experts say Malians far from the centre are suffering the worst effects of the crisis. With the armed groups changing locations and continuing attacks, the purely military approach Goita insists on may no longer be sufficient, analysts warn, and dialogue might be necessary.
“When you intensify fighting, you will, of course, see more attacks; it is just logical,” Diallo said. “And it’s ordinary civilians who are bearing the brunt of that.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/8/malian-juntas-move-to-hold-on-to-power-sparks-rare-revolt
Asia,Uncategorized,Did Pakistan shoot down five Indian fighter jets? What we know,"Four days after India and Pakistan reached a ceasefire after a rapid escalation in a military conflict between them, key differences between their battlefield claims remain unresolved.
Among them is Pakistan’s assertion that it shot down five Indian fighter jets on May 7, the first day of fighting, in response to Indian attacks on its territory.
As a battle of narratives takes over from the actual fighting, Al Jazeera takes stock of what we know about that claim, and why, if true, it matters.
Tensions between India and Pakistan erupted into military confrontation on May 7 after India bombed nine sites across six cities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
India said it had struck what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in response to the deadly April 22 killings of tourists by suspected rebels in India-administered Kashmir.
Gunmen on April 22 shot dead 25 male tourists and a local pony rider in the picturesque meadows of Pahalgam, triggering outrage and calls for revenge in India. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for supporting the fighters responsible for the attack, a charge Islamabad denied.
Pakistan said Indian forces on May 7 struck two cities in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and four sites in the country’s largest province, Punjab. It said civilians were killed in the attacks. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh rejected the Pakistani claims, reiterating that Indian forces “struck only those who harmed our innocents”.
Over the next four days, the two nuclear-armed neighbours were engaged in tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, while unleashing drones into each other’s territories.
Amid fears of a nuclear exchange, top officials from the United States made calls to Indian and Pakistani officials to end the conflict.
On May 10, US President Donald Trump announced that Washington had successfully mediated a ceasefire between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Despite initial accusations of violations by both sides, the ceasefire has continued to hold so far.
Pakistan reported on Tuesday that Indian strikes killed at least 51 people, including 11 soldiers and several children, while India has said at least five military personnel and 16 civilians died.
Speaking to Al Jazeera shortly after the May 7 attacks, Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Islamabad, in retaliation, had shot down five Indian jets, a drone, and many quadcopters.
Later in the day, Pakistan’s military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the warplanes had all been downed inside Indian territory, and aircraft from neither side crossed into the other’s territory during the attacks – an assertion India seconded.
“Neither India nor Pakistan had any need to send their own aircraft out of their own national airspace,” British defence analyst Michael Clarke told Al Jazeera.
“Their standoff weapons all had long enough ranges to reach their evident targets whilst flying in their own airspace,” Clarke, who is a visiting professor in the Department of War Studies at King’s College, London, added.
On Friday, Pakistan’s Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed claimed that among the five downed aircraft were three Rafales, a MiG-29, and an Su-30, providing electronic signatures of the aircraft, in addition to the exact locations where the planes were hit.
The battle between Pakistani and Indian jets lasted for just over an hour, Ahmed, who is also the deputy chief of operations, told reporters.
He stated that the confrontation featured at least 60 Indian aircraft, among them 14 French-made Rafales, while Pakistan deployed 42 “hi-tech aircraft,” including American F-16s and Chinese JF-17s and J-10s.
After Chinese state news outlet The Global Times wrote that Pakistan had brought down Indian fighter planes, India’s embassy in China described the report as “disinformation”.
However, beyond that, New Delhi has not formally confirmed or denied the reports.
Asked specifically whether Pakistan had managed to down Indian jets, India’s Director General of Air Operations AK Bharti avoided a direct answer.
“We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it,” he said. “As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that as we are still in combat and give advantage to the adversary. All our pilots are back home.”
Beyond the official accounts, local and international media outlets have reported different versions of Pakistan’s claims of downing the jets.
According to Indian security sources who spoke to Al Jazeera, three fighter jets crashed inside India-controlled territory.
They did not confirm which country the warplanes belonged to. However, with neither side suggesting that Pakistani planes crossed into Indian airspace, any debris in Indian-controlled territory likely comes from an Indian plane.
Reuters news agency also reported, citing four government sources in Indian-administered Kashmir, that three fighter jets crashed in the region. Reports in CNN said that at least two jets crashed, while a French source told the US outlet that at least one Rafale jet had been shot down.
Photos taken by AP news agency photo journalists showed debris of an aircraft in the Pulwama district in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Defence analyst Clarke said if India has indeed lost a Rafale, that would certainly be “embarrassing”.
“If it came down inside Indian territory, which must be the case if one was destroyed, then India will want to keep it only as a rumour for as long as possible,” he added.
“India has said that “losses” are inevitable, and that is probably as near as they will get to admitting a specific aircraft loss for a while.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/did-pakistan-shoot-down-five-indian-fighter-jets-what-we-know
Asia,Uncategorized,What did India and Pakistan gain – and lose – in their military standoff?,"Islamabad, Pakistan – Four days after a May 10 ceasefire pulled India and Pakistan back from the brink of a full-fledged war following days of rapidly escalating military tensions, a battle of narratives has broken out, with each country claiming “victory” over the other.
The conflict erupted after gunmen killed 26 civilians in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, on April 22. A little-known armed group, The Resistance Front (TRF), initially claimed responsibility, with India accusing Pakistan of backing it. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised retaliation, even though Pakistan denied any role in the attack.
After a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures between the neighbours, tensions exploded militarily. Early on the morning of May 7, India fired missiles at what it described as “terrorist” bases not just in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, but also four sites in Pakistan’s Punjab province.
In the following days, both sides launched killer drone strikes at each other’s territory and blamed one another for initiating the attacks.
Tensions peaked on Saturday when India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other’s military bases. India initially targeted three Pakistani airbases, including one in Rawalpindi, the garrison city which is home to the headquarters of the Pakistan Army, before then launching projectiles at other Pakistani bases. Pakistan’s missiles targeted military installations across the country’s frontier with India and Indian-administered Kashmir, striking at least four facilities.
Then, as the world braced for total war between the nuclear-armed neighbours, US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire, which he claimed had been mediated by the United States. Pakistan express gratitude to the US, even as India insisted the decision to halt fighting was made solely by the two neighbours without any third-party intervention.
Since the announcement, both countries have held news conferences, presenting “evidence” of their “achievements”. On Monday, senior military officials in India and Pakistan spoke by phone, pledging to uphold the ceasefire in the coming days.
However, analysts say neither side can truly claim to have emerged from the post-April 22 crisis with a definite upper hand. Instead, they say, both India and Pakistan can claim strategic gains even as they each also suffered losses.
The military standoff last week – like three of the four wars between India and Pakistan – had roots in the two countries’ dispute over the Kashmir region.
Pakistan and India administer different parts of Kashmir, along with China, which governs two narrow strips. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims the part India – but not Islamabad’s ally China – administers.
After the 1971 war between India and Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh, New Delhi and Islamabad inked the Simla Agreement, which, among other things, committed them to settling “their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations”.
Since then, India has argued that the Kashmir dispute – and other tensions between the neighbours – can only be settled bilaterally, without third-party intervention. Pakistan, however, has cited United Nations resolutions to call for the global community to play a role in pushing for a solution.
On Sunday, Trump said that the US was ready to help mediate a resolution to the Kashmir dispute. “I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir,” the US president posted on his Truth Social platform.
Walter Ladwig, a senior lecturer at King’s College London, said the latest conflict gave Pakistan a chance to internationalise the Kashmir issue, which had been its longstanding strategic goal.
“Islamabad welcomed mediation from a range of countries, including the US, framing the resulting ceasefire as evidence of the need for external involvement,” Ladwig told Al Jazeera.
By contrast, he said, India had to accept a ceasefire brokered externally, rather than ending the conflict on its own terms.
Sudha Ramachandran, the South Asia editor for The Diplomat magazine, said that Modi’s government in India may have strengthened its nationalist support base through its military operation, though it may have also lost some domestic political points with the ceasefire.
“It was able to score points among its nationalist hawkish support base. But the ceasefire has not gone down well among hardliners,” Ramachandran said.
Highlighting ‘terrorism’: India’s gain
However, analysts also say the spiral in tensions last week, and its trigger in the form of the Pahalgam attack, helped India too.
“Diplomatically, India succeeded in refocusing international attention on Pakistan-based militant groups, renewing calls for Islamabad to take meaningful action,” Ladwig said.
He referred to “the reputational cost [for Pakistan] of once again being associated with militant groups operating from its soil”.
“While Islamabad denied involvement and called for neutral investigations, the burden of proof in international forums increasingly rests on Pakistan to demonstrate proactive counterterrorism efforts,” Ladwig added.
India has long accused Pakistan of financing, training and sheltering armed groups that support the secession of Kashmir from India. Pakistan insists it only provides diplomatic and moral support to Kashmir’s separatist movement.
Planes down may be Pakistan’s gain
India claimed that its strikes on May 7 killed more than 100 “terrorists”. Pakistan said the Indian missiles had hit mosques and residential areas, killing 40 civilians, including children, apart from 11 military personnel.
Islamabad also claimed that it scrambled its fighter planes to respond and had brought down multiple Indian jets.
India has neither confirmed nor denied those claims, but Pakistan’s military has publicly shared details that it says identify the planes that were shot down. French and US officials have confirmed that at least one Rafale and one Russian-made jet were lost by India.
Indian officials have also confirmed to Al Jazeera that at least two planes crashed in Indian-administered territory, but did not clarify which country they belonged to.
With both India and Pakistan agreeing that neither side’s jets had crossed their frontier, the presence of debris from a crashed plane in Indian-administered territory suggests they were likely Indian, say analysts.
The ceasefire coming after that suggests a gain for Pakistan, Asfandyar Mir, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. “Especially, the downing of the aircraft confirmed by various independent sources. So, it [Pakistan] may see the ceasefire as being better for consolidating that dividend.”
Muhammad Shoaib, an academic and security analyst at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, called India’s strikes against Pakistan a strategic miscalculation. “Their reading of Pakistan’s ability to hit back was flawed,” he said.
Ladwig, however, said it would be a mistake to overstate the significance of any Pakistani successes, such as the possible downing of Indian jets. “These are, at best, symbolic victories. They do not represent a clear or unambiguous military gain,” he said.
In many ways, analysts say that the more meaty military accomplishment was India’s.
In addition to Kotli and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Indian missiles on May 7 also targeted four sites in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous state and the country’s economic nerve-centre.
Over the next two days, India also fired drones that reached deep inside Pakistani territory, including major Pakistani population centres such as Lahore and Karachi.
And on May 10, Indian missiles hit three Pakistani airbases that were deeper in Pakistan’s Punjab than the Indian bases Pakistan hit that day were in Indian territory.
Simply put, India demonstrated greater reach than Pakistan did. It was the first time since the 1971 war between them that India had managed to hit Punjab.
Launching a military response not just across the Line of Control, the two countries’ de-facto border in Kashmir, but deep into Pakistan had been India’s primary goal, said Ramchandran. And India achieved it.
Ladwig, too, said that India’s success in targeting Punjab represented a serious breach of Pakistan’s defensive posture.
Military officials from both countries who spoke on Monday and agreed to hold the ceasefire also agreed to take immediate steps to reduce their troops’ presence along the borders. A second round of talks is expected within 48 hours.
However, later that day, Indian Prime Minister Modi said that the fighting had merely “paused”.
Still, the Stimson Center’s Mir believes the ceasefire could hold.
“Both sides face constraints and opportunities that have emerged during the course of the last week, which, on balance, make a ceasefire a better outcome for them,” he said.
Ladwig echoed that view, saying the truce reflects mutual interest in de-escalation, even if it does not resolve the tensions that led to the crisis.
“India has significantly changed the rules of the game in this episode. The Indian government seems to have completely dispensed with the game that allows Islamabad and Rawalpindi to claim plausible deniability regarding anti-Indian terrorist groups,” he said.
“What the Pakistani government and military do with groups on its soil would seem to be the key factor in determining how robust the ceasefire will be.”
Quaid-i-Azam University’s Shoaib, who is also a research fellow at George Mason University in the US, emphasised the importance of continued dialogue.
He warned that maintaining peace will depend on security dynamics in both Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistan’s Balochistan province.
Just as India accuses Pakistan of supporting cross-border separatism, Islamabad alleges that New Delhi backs a separatist insurgency in Balochistan, a claim India denies.
“Any subsequent bout of violence has the potential to get bloodier and more widespread,” Shoaib said. “Both sides, going for a war of attrition, could inflict significant damage on urban populations, without gaining anything from the conflict.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/what-did-india-and-pakistan-gain-and-lose-in-their-military-standoff

Asia,Uncategorized,‘No guardrails’: How India-Pakistan combat obliterated old red lines,"New Delhi, India – Guns have fallen silent for now along the tense India-Pakistan frontier, after a ceasefire that appears to have held for three nights.
On May 7, India launched predawn attacks on what it called multiple “terror sites” across Pakistan to avenge the April 22 killing of 26 men, almost all of them tourists, in Indian-administered Kashmir’s resort town of Pahalgam. New Delhi accused Islamabad of backing the gunmen. Pakistan denied its involvement.
India’s aerial assault kick-started four days of heightened tension, as both neighbours fired missiles and drones at each other’s military installations in a rapidly escalating cycle that brought them to the brink of full-scale war.
Both sides have claimed to have decisively damaged, even destroyed, the other’s key strategic facilities, even though early evidence suggests more limited damage to military bases in both India and Pakistan.
Yet even as India and Pakistan arrived at a ceasefire that United States President Donald Trump insists his administration brokered, experts say something has indeed been decimated, potentially beyond repair: Old red lines that had defined the tense relationship between the South Asian neighbours.
“India and Pakistan have entered a phase of ‘armed coexistence’ with little room for diplomacy and a narrow margin for error, despite having a live and sensitive border,” Praveen Donthi, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera.
“This situation does not bode well for either country or the region, because even accidental triggers could escalate into a war-like situation with no guardrails in place.”
The seeds of the India-Pakistan conflict were sown when their independence from British rule in 1947 was accompanied by a partition of the Indian subcontinent to create Pakistan.
Since then, the two neighbours have fought four wars, three of them over Kashmir, a region they both control partially along with China, which governs two thin slices in the north. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims all parts other than the ones governed by China, its ally.
After their 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan signed what is known as the Simla Agreement, which said “the two countries are resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.”
While Pakistan has often cited United Nations resolutions to argue for international involvement in the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, India has cited the Simla Agreement for more than half a century to insist that any negotiations between the countries be strictly bilateral.
To be sure, the US has since intervened to calm tensions between India and Pakistan: In 1999, for instance, President Bill Clinton pressured Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw troops from the icy heights of Indian-controlled Kargil, where they had entered. However, Washington publicly played coy about its role, allowing India to insist that the US had only helped with crisis management, not any dispute resolution mediation.
That changed on Saturday, when US President Donald Trump upstaged New Delhi and Islamabad to announce a “full and immediate” India-Pakistan ceasefire hours before the governments of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi or his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif confirmed the development.
The next day, Trump went further. “I will work with you, both to see if, after a ‘thousand years,’ a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.
And on Monday, merely 30 minutes before Modi was scheduled for his first address since India launched attacks in Pakistan, Trump told reporters at the White House that his administration had leveraged trade to reach a ceasefire. “Let’s stop [the fighting]. If you stop it, we’ll do a trade. If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade,” Trump said. “And all of a sudden they said, ‘I think we’re going to stop.’ For a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one.”
Such US mediation, were it to happen, would shatter India’s longstanding red line against mediation by other countries, say experts.
“India has consistently sought to avoid third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute even as it has occasionally welcomed third-party help in crisis management,” Christopher Clary, a former Pentagon official and a non-resident fellow at the Washington, DC-based Stimson Center, told Al Jazeera.
When he spoke, Modi largely stuck to traditional positions he has taken after previous bouts of tension with Pakistan. He said “terror and talks cannot happen together,” and “water and blood cannot flow together,” a reference to the Indus Waters Treaty for sharing water between India and Pakistan, which New Delhi walked out of after the Pahalgam attack.
Unlike Pakistan PM Sharif, who expressed gratitude to Trump for brokering a ceasefire, Modi claimed that India had “only paused” its military action – noting the decision was taken bilaterally. He did not mention Trump or his administration.
Regardless, “the spectre of international intervention” in Kashmir has been resurrected, said Sumantra Bose, political scientist and the author of the 2021 book Kashmir at the Crossroads. He said India’s furious barrage of missiles and drones at Pakistan in response to the Pahalgam killings “catered to domestic jingoism but naturally roused global alarm”.
India might, however, be helped in avoiding actual US intervention in Kashmir by the immediacy of the Trump administration’s other foreign policy goals, like the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, “that will divert already overburdened [American] policymakers to other tasks”, said Clary.
According to Bose, India and Pakistan crossed not just red lines, “but a Rubicon by attacking numerous high-population targets in cities and towns” last week.
India, in its most expansive offensive against Pakistan outside full-blown wars, said it hit “terrorist infrastructure” on May 7 as part of what it called Operation Sindoor. That was a reference to the vermillion that married Hindu women apply to their forehead, and an allusion to the manner in which the Pahalgam attack appears to have unfolded: Multiple witness accounts suggest the attackers segregated the men, then picked and hit non-Muslims.
Modi claimed, in his Monday statement, that the Indian attacks had killed more than 100 “terrorists”. Pakistan has insisted that only 31 civilians – including two children – were killed in the May attacks.
Yet both sides agree that the Indian missiles struck not just two cities – Muzaffarrabad and Kotli – in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, but also four cities in Pakistan’s Punjab province, the county’s economic heart and home to 60 percent of its population. The targets were Bahawalpur, Muridke, Shakar Garh and a village near Sialkot. This was the first time that India had struck Punjab since the 1971 war.
As tensions spiked, India accused Pakistan of unleashing a swarm of drones towards it – a charge Islamabad denied. Then India launched a wave of drones that reached Pakistan’s biggest population centres, including its two biggest cities, Karachi and Lahore. In the early hours of May 10, India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other’s military bases across multiple provinces – far beyond disputed Kashmir – even hitting a few.
Pakistan, which called its campaign Operation Bunyan Marsoos (a structure made of lead, in Arabic), targeted Indian air force bases and missile storage facilities in Drangyari, Udhampur, Uri and Nagrota (all in Indian-administered Kashmir), as well as in Pathankot, Beas and Adampur in Indian Punjab and Bhuj in Gujarat, Modi’s home state. Indian armed forces said that while they shot down most incoming missiles and drones, four air force bases suffered “limited damage”.
“We don’t know what the quantum [of Indian losses] are, but clearly Pakistan has demonstrated capability to impose costs on India even as we try to impose costs on them,” Indian military historian and strategic analyst Srinath Raghavan told Al Jazeera.
“Regarding red lines, another thing Pakistan sought to demonstrate was that they could keep this [the fighting] going till they had hit Indian military installations in retaliation.”
Meanwhile, India too targeted the Nur Khan airbase near Rawalpindi, Murid airbase in Chakwal and the Rafiqui airbase in Shorkot.
“India has shown that it is willing and capable of carrying out more strikes across the border, whether it’s a terrorist or even military infrastructure in Pakistan,” Raghavan said. India’s response went far beyond what happened in 2019, when Indian jets bombed what they described as a “terrorist camp” in Balakot, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, after a suicide bomber killed more than 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers.
Now, the 2025 attacks will serve as the new baseline for India, experts said.
“India would respond [in the future] on a similar scale, perhaps even a little bit more. Given the way both Balakot and the current crisis have played out, that should be the expectation,” said Raghavan.
It isn’t just missiles and drones that the two sides fired at each other, though.
Right after the Pahalgam attack, India suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, a 1960 agreement that had previously survived three wars – in 1965, 1971 and 1999 – unscathed. The treaty gives India access to the waters of the three eastern rivers of the Indus basin: The Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Pakistan, in turn, gets the waters of the three western rivers: The Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.
The river system is a vital lifeline for Pakistan, which relies on its waters. India, as the upper riparian state, has the ability – in theory at least – to restrict or stop the flow of the water into Pakistan. Islamabad described New Delhi’s decision to walk away from its obligations under the Indus Waters Treaty as an “act of war”.
In an incendiary remark at the peak of the tensions, Pakistani former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto said “either the water will flow, or their blood will,” seemingly referring to Indians.
Three days after the ceasefire was announced, India has still not recommitted itself to the pact. In his speech on Monday evening, Modi’s statement that “blood and water cannot flow together” signalled that New Delhi had not yet decided to return to the treaty.
Even as India and Pakistan ratcheted up their measures – first diplomatically, then militarily – against each other, the rest of the world was spooked by the prospect of what could have turned into a full-blown war between nuclear-armed neighbours.
Up until now, that reality of nuclear weapons has affected India’s decisions in terms of how it treats its tensions with Pakistan, said Clary, the former Pentagon official. “India’s goal is to punish Pakistan without risking nuclear danger,” he said.
But on Monday, Modi appeared to suggest that New Delhi was reassessing that approach. “India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail,” he said.
Modi’s comments pointed to a “fundamental shift that has occurred in relations between India and Pakistan”, Donthi, the International Crisis Group analyst, said. “Both sides are willing to take greater risks and explore the potential for escalation below the nuclear threshold. However, there is very little space there, effectively making the euphemism of the region being a nuclear flashpoint truer than ever.”
Modi’s comments on “nuclear blackmail” weren’t the only ones that marked a break from the past.
When India launched attacks against Pakistan on May 7, it emphasised that it was only targeting “terrorist” bases and not attacking Pakistani military installations. However, on Monday, Modi said that in future, “India will not differentiate between the government sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism.”
That position raises the danger of war, said experts.
“The conflation of terrorists and their (alleged) backers – namely, the military and the government – portends serious risks,” Donthi said. “It assumes that they are in lockstep. Such an assumption doesn’t take into account facts such as the seemingly successful ceasefire.”
India and Pakistan had signed a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in 2003 and had renewed it in 2021. Despite cross-border firing along the LoC, the ceasefire had largely held until last week.
With the threshold for a military conflict lowered, “the situation has become precarious,” Donthi said.
“A single militant attack is all it takes to plunge into war, leaving no room for diplomacy and raising no questions. Any power hostile to either or both sides can exploit this.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/no-guardrails-how-india-pakistan-combat-obliterated-old-red-lines

Asia,Uncategorized,India’s Modi says fighting ‘only paused’ in wake of conflict with Pakistan,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said India “only paused” its military action against Pakistan, in his first speech to the nation since a ceasefire following a fierce military confrontation last week that threatened a fifth all-out war between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Speaking on Wednesday, the ultranationalist Hindu leader said in New Delhi that his government will not make a distinction between governments that support “terrorism” and “terrorist groups”. He said India would “retaliate on its own terms” if there is any future “terror” attack on the country.
The Indian military launched multiple missile attacks targeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on May 6, claiming it had hit “terrorist infrastructure”.
Pakistan rejected that claim.
Pakistan chose to “attack” India rather than combat terrorism, Modi stated, asserting that his country “will not tolerate nuclear blackmail”.
“We will be monitoring every step of Pakistan,” Modi added, saying that “This is not an era of war, but this is not an era of terrorism, either.”
Turning to the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, Modi said, “Terror and trade cannot go together, water and blood cannot flow together.”
The treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has long survived multiple crises between the two rivals. However, India’s recent decision to stop the flow of water signals a sharp diplomatic shift, using water that Pakistan relies on for agricultural and civilian purposes as leverage.
Pakistan’s Finance Minister said in an interview with the Reuters news agency on Monday that the Indus Waters Treaty, unilaterally suspended by India, “has to be rolled back to where it was”.
On Monday, United States President Donald Trump claimed that by helping to broker the ceasefire, his administration had prevented “a nuclear conflict”.
New Delhi has blamed Islamabad for a deadly April 22 attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in Pahalgam, during which 26 people were killed – a charge Pakistan strongly denies.
According to their partial counts, the fighting since last week killed around 60 civilians on both sides.
India’s and Pakistan’s top military commanders were expected to revisit a recently brokered ceasefire agreement on Monday evening.
The Indian Army earlier reported a “calm night”, as authorities said the night passed peacefully across disputed Kashmir and the international border, with no new incidents reported.
A senior Indian defence official confirmed that talks, originally scheduled for noon local time, were pushed to later in the day. The discussions, analysts say, will likely focus on technical details to prevent future flare-ups rather than shape long-term policy.
Abdul Basit, a South Asia specialist at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the purpose of the exchange is to establish clear lines and avoid missteps.
“The goal is to avoid any miscalculations, because right now one spark could quickly move towards a nuclear catastrophe,” Basit told the AFP news agency.
The spike in hostilities had marked the most serious confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbours since their last declared conflict in 1999.
As tensions cooled, Indian authorities reopened 32 airports on Monday that had been shut down due to the fighting.
Civilians in Kashmir have suffered the most in the crossfire.
Military leaders in both countries spent Sunday delivering pointed briefings, each asserting they had won while pledging restraint.
“We have delivered the promise we made to our people,” Pakistan’s military spokesman Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry declared, describing the recent operation as a “success on the battleground”.
Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed added that Pakistan had “re-established deterrence and neutralised key threats”.
India’s Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai insisted that his country had shown “immense restraint,” but warned: “Any threat to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and safety of our citizens will be met with decisive force.”
Both nations remain on high alert despite the temporary calm, as the world watches for signs of lasting de-escalation or a reignition of hostilities.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/12/indias-modi-says-fighting-only-paused-in-wake-of-conflict-with-pakistan
Asia,Uncategorized,"UK veterans allege war crimes by British forces in Afghanistan, Iraq","Former members of the United Kingdom’s special forces have described alleged war crimes committed by British soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq dating back over a decade.
More than 30 witnesses who served with or alongside special forces soldiers broke their silence to the BBC’s Panorama programme and spoke about illegal killings and executions of detainees, including children, during the invasions of the two countries.
David Cameron – who was prime minister from June 2010 to November 2013, the period now under scrutiny by a judge-led public inquiry into special forces – was repeatedly made aware of concerns about night raids and killings raised by then-Afghan President Hamid Karzai, according to the BBC.
A spokesman for Cameron said “any suggestion that [he] colluded in covering up allegations of serious criminal wrongdoing is total nonsense”.
The special air service and the navy’s special boat service, the UK’s top special forces units, were at the centre of the testimonies.
“They handcuffed a young boy and shot him,” recalled one veteran who served with the elite soldiers in Afghanistan. ”He was clearly a child, not even close to fighting age.”
Killing of detainees “became routine”, the veteran said, adding that the soldiers would remove plastic handcuffs from executed detainees and plant weapons by their bodies to make it look like they were fighters in photographs taken from the scene.
Another veteran with the navy’s special forces regiment said some service members displayed “barbaric” and “psychopathic” behaviour as they felt untouchable by the law.
One former soldier described the killings as something that could turn “addictive” as some soldiers became “intoxicated by that feeling” in Afghanistan.
“On some operations, the troops would go into guesthouse-type buildings and kill everyone there,” he said. “They’d go in and shoot everyone sleeping there, on entry. It’s not justified, killing people in their sleep.”
Even wounded people who did not pose a threat to anyone were executed in breach of international law, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A former special forces operator said an execution of an unarmed person in Iraq was never properly investigated, adding that senior commanders were aware of the problem long before deploying to Afghanistan.
The BBC also obtained new video evidence that showed squadrons kept kill counts to compete with others.
One veteran said a former colleague was trying to get kills on every single operation, having become “notorious” for killing dozens of people.
Another veteran said “everyone knew” about the killings in the UK special forces command with testimonies indicating officers would falsify postoperational reports to avoid scrutiny.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/12/uk-veterans-allege-war-crimes-by-british-forces-in-afghanistan-iraq

Asia,Sports,What to know about Virat Kohli’s retirement from Test cricket,"After 14 years playing Test matches, Virat Kohli is retiring from the national team as one of the immortals of Indian cricket.
“Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life,” Kohli wrote on Monday in his Test retirement social media post.
“There’s something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no-one sees but that stay with you forever,” he added.
Here is all to know about the retirement of India’s hugely impactful batter and captain:
Kohli’s declining form in the five-day format of cricket may have prompted his decision to call it a day.
After averaging close to 55 at his peak between 2011 and 2019, he could muster a batting average of just 32.56 over the past 24 months.
Kohli’s last Test was in Sydney in January when India lost the match, and with it the series 3-1, to Australia.
Apart from an unbeaten century in the second innings of the first Test in Perth, Kohli managed just 90 runs from eight innings in the five-Test series.
Kohli has previously cited mental fatigue and injuries as other reasons to consider retirement.
“As I step away from this format, it’s not easy – but it feels right. I’ve given it everything I had, and it’s given me back so much more than I could’ve hoped for,” Kohli said.
Kohli used #269 in his Instagram post while announcing his retirement on Monday.
The number denotes Kohli as the 269th player who represented India in Test cricket.
Kohli will continue to play for the Indian cricket team in One-Day International (ODI) matches, but with Test match commitments removed from his schedule, he will now have more time to pursue other interests outside of the game.
The 36-year-old has an expanding business empire in India. He is an active investor in large-scale fitness, hospitality and clothing companies such as Chisel fitness centre, Rage Coffee, sportswear brand One8, WROGN menswear brand and Blue Tribe, to name just a few.
He is also a global brand ambassador for multiple international companies, including Puma, Audi and Vivo.
Unlike many top cricketers, Kohli has not indicated that he will pursue a cricket commentary career, but he has repeatedly talked about giving back to the game in some form, with coaching a possible option in the future.
In December 2024, it was widely reported that Kohli was planning to leave India and settle in London with his wife, actor Anushka Sharma, and their two children, daughter Vamika and son Akaay, according to his childhood cricket coach Rajkumar Yadav, who hinted at the impending move in an interview with Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran.
It has been reported that Kohli’s net worth is about 96 million pounds ($126m) from salaries, businesses and endorsement deals.
Married to a Bollywood star, Kohli has 272 million followers on Instagram and 67.8 million on X – making him one of the most followed sports stars on the planet.
His popularity has been a key factor behind cricket’s return to the Olympics at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, the organisers acknowledged last year.
Greg Chappell, former Australia captain:
“Kohli redefined expectations, challenged conventions, and symbolised the self-assured, unapologetic India of the 21st century,” Chappell said in a piece on ESPN CricInfo.
“His departure leaves not only a statistical void but a seismic shift in energy – for there has never been another quite like him.
“No Indian captain had ever marshalled a team to such commanding overseas dominance. And no batter since Tendulkar had so unequivocally ruled in every continent.”
Jasprit Bumrah, India bowler:
“From making my Test debut under your captaincy to reaching new heights together for our country, your passion and energy will be missed but the legacy you leave behind remains unmatched.”
Sanath Jayasuriya, former Sri Lanka captain:
“While the world celebrates your cricketing brilliance and records, what I admire most is your unwavering commitment to fitness and the sacrifices you’ve made behind the scenes.”
Yashasvi Jaiswal, India’s opening batsman:
“The impact you’ve had on test cricket, and on cricket in India as a whole, is immeasurable. To have had the chance to share the pitch with you – someone I looked up to for so many years – was more than just a privilege; it was a moment I’ll carry with me forever.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/12/why-did-virat-kohli-retire-from-tests-and-what-does-269-mean

Asia,Sports,India great Virat Kohli follows Rohit Sharma into Test cricket retirement,"India batsman Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket, bringing down the curtain on a sparkling career in the longest format just days after captain Rohit Sharma did the same.
Kohli, who made his debut in 2011 and scored 30 centuries and 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85 over 123 tests, is expected to remain available for one-day internationals.
The 36-year-old quit Twenty20 International immediately after India won their second 20-over World Cup trophy in the West Indies last year.
“It’s been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in test cricket. Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on,” Kohli posted on Instagram on Monday.
“It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life.
“There’s something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.”
While Kohli’s final test wrapped up a 3-1 test series defeat by Australia in January, which saw India relinquish the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade, he will be remembered most for his spell as captain between 2014 and 2022.
Kohli won 40 of his 68 tests in charge of India to become the country’s most successful skipper in the format, and sits fourth in the list of captains with the most test victories.
Only Graeme Smith (53), Ricky Ponting (48) and Steve Waugh (41) won more tests as captains.
India suffered only 17 defeats with Kohli at the helm as he guided the side to the final of the inaugural World Test Championship in 2021, when they lost to New Zealand.
He was also part of the team that lost the second World Test Championship final to Australia in 2023.
“I’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude – for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,” he added.
“I’ll always look back at my test career with a smile.”

Asia,Politics,Pakistan’s stance against “all-out war” should be taken seriously,,https://www.aljazeera.com/program/quotable/
Asia,Sports,"As India, Pakistan claim win, Kashmiris ask: ‘Who suffered the most?’","Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — On Saturday morning at Fateh Kadal, a densely packed neighbourhood on the sloping embankment of the Jhelum River in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s largest city, 62-year-old Hajira wrapped a cotton scarf with a brown paisley design around her shoulders.
With her face muscles tense and sweat beading across her upper lip, she sat on the cement floor of a government-run grains store.
“Can you make it quick?” she called to the person manning the store.
Hajira comes to the store every month to submit her biometric details, as required by the government to secure the release of her monthly quota of subsidised grains, which her family of four depends on.
But this time was different. The past few days have been unprecedented for residents of Indian-administered Kashmir. Drones hovered overhead, airports were shut down, explosions rang out, people were killed in cross-border fire, and the region prepared for the possibility of an all-out war.
“He made me stand in the queue,” she said, flinching from knee pain, referring to the store operator. “But there’s uncertainty around. I just want my share of rice so I can quickly return. A war is coming.”
Then, on Saturday evening, Hajira breathed a sigh of relief. United States President Donald Trump announced that he had succeeded in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.
“I thank God for this,” Hajira said, smiling sheepishly. “Perhaps he understood that I didn’t have the means to endure the financial hardship that a war-like situation would have caused.”
On Sunday morning, Trump went a step further, saying in a post on his Truth Social platform that he would try to work with India and Pakistan to resolve their longstanding dispute over Kashmir, a region both countries partly control but claim in its entirety.
Political analyst Zafar Choudhary, based in the city of Jammu in southern Kashmir, told Al Jazeera that New Delhi would not be happy about Trump’s statement. India has long argued that Pakistan-sponsored “terrorism” is the primary reason for tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
However, “Trump’s offer underlines the fact that Kashmir remains central to India-Pakistan confrontations”, Choudhary said.
And for Kashmiris, the hope stemming from the fragile pause in fighting between India and Pakistan, and Trump’s offer to mediate talks on Kashmir, is tempered by scepticism borne from a decades-long, desperate wait for peace.
Hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris stood in the direct line of fire between India and Pakistan in recent days.
As the neighbouring nations launched missiles and drones at each other, Kashmiri communities near the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border with Pakistan, also witnessed cross-border shelling on a scale unseen in decades, triggering an exodus of people towards safer locations.
The shadow of conflict has stalked their lives for nearly four decades, since an armed rebellion first erupted against the Indian government in the late 1980s. Then, in 2019, the government scrapped Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status amid a huge security crackdown – thousands of people were imprisoned.
On April 22, a brutal attack by gunmen on tourists at Pahalgam killed 26 civilians, shattering the normalcy critics had accused India of projecting in the disputed region.
Since then, in addition to a diplomatic tit-for-tat and missile exchanges with Pakistan, the Indian government has intensified its crackdown on the armed groups active in Kashmir.
It has demolished the homes of rebels accused of links to the Pahalgam attack, raided other homes across the region and detained approximately 2,800 people, 90 of whom have been booked under the Public Safety Act, a draconian preventive detention law. The police also summoned many journalists and arrested at least one for “promoting secessionist ideology”.
By Sunday, while a sense of jubilation swept through the region over the ceasefire, many people were still cautious, doubtful even, about whether the truce brokered by Trump would hold.
Just hours after both countries declared a cessation of hostilities, loud explosions rang out in major urban centres across Kashmir as a swarm of kamikaze drones from Pakistan raced across the airspace.
Many residents raced to the terraces of their apartments and homes to capture videos of the drones being brought down by India’s defence systems, a trail of bright red dots arcing across the night sky before exploding midair.
As part of the emergency protocols, the authorities turned off the electricity supply. Fearing that the debris from drones would fall on them, residents ran for safety. The surge of drones through the night skies also touched off sirens, triggering a sense of dread.
“I don’t think I have ever been more frightened before,” said Hasnain Shabir, a 24-year-old business graduate from Srinagar. “The streets have been robbed of all their life. If the prelude to war looks like this, I don’t know what war will look like.”
Hours after the ceasefire was announced on Saturday, India accused Pakistan of violating it by shelling border regions. Residents across major towns in Kashmir were on their toes, once again, after drones reappeared in the skies.
One of the worst-affected places in Kashmir during these days is Uri, a picturesque town of pear orchards and walnut groves close to India’s contested border with Pakistan.
The village is surrounded by majestic mountains through which the Jhelum flows. It is the final frontier on the Indian-administered side before the hills pave the way to Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
Parts of Uri saw intense shelling, forcing the residents to leave their homes and look for safety. On May 8, officials told Al Jazeera that a woman, Nargis Bashir, was killed in her car as she and her family tried to flee the border region, like thousands of others, after flying shrapnel tore through the vehicle. Three of her family members were wounded.
Muhammad Naseer Khan, 60, a former serviceman, was huddling in his room when Pakistani artillery fire hit a nearby military post, with metal shards blasting through the walls of his house. “The blast has damaged one side of my home,” Khan said, wearing a traditional blue shirt and a tweed coat.
“I don’t know if this place is even liveable,” he said, his bright blue eyes betraying a sense of fear.
Despite the ceasefire, his two daughters and many others in his family who had left for a relative’s house, away from the disputed border, are sceptical about returning. “My children are refusing to return. They have no guarantee that guns won’t roar again,” he said.
Suleman Sheikh, a 28-year-old resident in Uri, recalled his childhood years when his grandfather would talk about the Bofors artillery guns stationed inside a military garrison in the nearby village of Mohra.
“He told us that the last time this gun had roared was in 1999, when India and Pakistan clashed on the icy peaks of Kargil. It is a conventional belief here that if this gun roared again, things are going to get too bad,” he said.
That is what happened at 2am on May 8. As the Bofors guns in Mohra prepared to fire ammunition across the mountains into Pakistan, Sheikh felt the ground shaking beneath him. An hour and a half later, a shell fired from the other side hit an Indian paramilitary installation nearby, making a long hissing noise before striking with a thud.
Hours after Sheikh spoke to Al Jazeera, another shell landed on his home. The rooms and the portico of his house collapsed, according to a video he shared with Al Jazeera later.
He had refused to leave his home despite his family’s pleas to join them. “I was here to protect our livestock,” Sheikh said. “I didn’t want to leave them alone.”
Unlike the rest of the Kashmir valley, where apple cultivation brings millions of dollars in income for the region, Uri is relatively poor. Villagers mostly work odd jobs for the Indian Army, which maintains large garrisons there, or farm walnuts and pears. Livestock rearing has turned into a popular vocation for many in the town.
“We have the firsthand experience of what war feels like. It is good that the ceasefire has taken place. But I don’t know if it will hold or not,” Sheikh said, his face downcast. “I pray that it does.”
Back in Srinagar, residents are slowly returning to the rhythm of their daily lives. Schools and colleges remain closed, and people are avoiding unnecessary travel.
The scenes of racing drone fleets in the skies and the accompanying blasts are seared into public memory. “Only in the evening will we come to know whether this ceasefire has held on,” said Muskaan Wani, a student of medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, on Sunday.
It did, overnight, but the tension over whether it will last remains.
Political experts attribute the general scepticism about the ceasefire to the unresolved political issues in the region – a point that was echoed in Trump’s statement on Sunday, in which he referred to a possible “solution concerning Kashmir”.
“The problem to begin with is the political alienation [of Kashmiris],” said Noor Ahmad Baba, a former professor and head of the political science department at the University of Kashmir.
“People in Kashmir feel humiliated for what has happened to them in the last few years, and there haven’t been any significant efforts to win them over. When there’s humiliation, there is suspicion.”
Others in Indian-administered Kashmir expressed their anger at both countries for ruining their lives.
“I doubt that our feelings as Kashmiris even matter,” said Furqan, a software engineer in Srinagar who gave his first name only. “Two nuclear powers fought, caused damage and casualties at the borders, gave their respective nations a spectacle to watch, their goals were achieved, and then they stopped the war.
“But the question is, who suffered the most? It’s us. For the world, we are nothing but collateral damage.”
Furqan said his friends were sceptical about the ceasefire when the two countries resumed shelling on the evening of May 10.
“We all already were like, ‘It is not gonna last,'” he said. “And then we heard the explosions again.”
Muneeb Mehraj, a 26-year-old resident of Srinagar who studies management in the northern Indian state of Punjab, echoed Furqan.
“For others, the war may be over. A ceasefire has been declared. But once again, it’s Kashmiris who have paid the price – lives lost, homes destroyed, peace shattered,” he said. “How long must this cycle continue?”
“We are exhausted,” Mehraj continued. “We don’t want another temporary pause. We want a lasting, permanent solution.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/12/we-want-permanent-solution-fear-and-fatigue-in-kashmir-after-ceasefire

US & Canada,Sports,"What to know about MLB’s decision to lift bans on Pete Rose, Joe Jackson","Pete Rose and “Shoeless Joe” Jackson have been reinstated by Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Rob Manfred, making both eligible for the sport’s Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by gambling scandals.
Rose’s permanent ban was lifted on Tuesday, eight months after his death and a day before the Cincinnati Reds honour baseball’s career hits leader with Pete Rose Night.
Manfred announced he was changing the league’s policy on permanent ineligibility, saying bans would expire at death.
Here is all to know about the MLB lifting the ban on two of baseball’s all-time great players:
Rose and Jackson were considered longstanding pariahs in Major League Baseball due to their gambling on the sport.
Jackson was a member of the Chicago White Sox team that were accused of conspiring with gamblers to purposely lose the 1919 World Series.
He accepted $5,000 to throw the series, which the Cincinnati Reds won. Eight players from that White Sox team, despite avoiding criminal charges, were banned from organised baseball in 1921.
Rose was caught betting on games while manager of the Cincinnati Reds and was barred for life from baseball by Commissioner Bart Giamatti in 1989.
Jackson’s phenomenal career batting average of .356 is the fourth highest in MLB history. Later, after he was banned from the majors, he played baseball under assumed names in southern leagues in the United States.
Jackson died in 1951 but remains one of baseball’s most recognisable names in part for his depiction by actor Ray Liotta in the 1989 movie Field of Dreams.
Rose set MLB career records for hits (4,256), games played (3,562) and at-bats (14,053) – among others – and finished with a .303 career batting average. He won the World Series three times, twice with the Reds and once with the Philadelphia Phillies.
Rose also won three batting titles, two Gold Glove Awards, the National League Rookie of the Year and the National League Most Valuable Player.
Rose died on September 30 aged 83.
Rose’s supporters have included US President Donald Trump, who expressed on social media in March that he intends to pardon Rose posthumously. Trump didn’t specify what a Rose pardon would be for, but he was sentenced to five months in prison for submitting falsified tax returns in 1990.
Manfred discussed Rose with Trump when the pair met in April, but he hasn’t disclosed specifics of their conversation other than they discussed Rose’s eligibility for reinstatement into the league.
Was Trump’s pardon post two months earlier behind the MLB’s decision on Tuesday to lift the bans on Rose and Jackson?
The MLB would point to its in-house disciplinary procedures as the only way for disgraced players to be formally reinstated into the league.
Rose and Jackson won’t be eligible to come up for a vote until the Hall of Fame’s Classic Era Baseball committee meets in December 2027.
The committee is responsible for voting on individuals who made their biggest impact in baseball before 1980.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/14/why-were-pete-rose-shoeless-joe-jackson-banned-from-baseball-hall-of-fame
US & Canada,Politics,Syrians celebrate US president’s decision to remove sanction,,https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/
US & Canada,Politics,"Trump meets Syria’s al-Sharaa, eyes normalisation of ties with Damascus","United States President Donald Trump says Washington is considering the normalisation of ties with Damascus after he met Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa in the first such encounter between the two nations’ leaders in 25 years.
Trump made the announcement on Wednesday at a meeting with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) leaders in Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, during which he also said the US will drop “all sanctions” against Syria.
“With the support of the great leaders in this room, we are currently exploring normalising relations with Syria’s new government,” Trump said, confirming his brief meeting with al-Sharaa.
The “cessation of sanctions” will give Syria “a fresh start”, Trump said.
“We will be dropping all sanctions.”
Trump met al-Sharaa, who once pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda and swept to power in Syria at the head of a group of opposition fighters, before a summit between the United States and Gulf Arab countries.
Photos posted on Saudi state media showed them shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joined Trump and MBS virtually in the meeting, Turkiye’s Anadolu News Agency reported.
In a statement, the White House said that during the meeting, Trump asked al-Sharaa to deport Palestinians it described as “terrorists”, “sign onto the Abraham Accords with Israel” and “assume responsibility for ISIS detention centres in northeast Syria”.
On Tuesday night, Trump had announced he was lifting sanctions on the war-battered country, drawing praise from Arab leaders and celebrations in the streets across Syria.
Trump’s pledge to lift sanctions could be a major turning point for a country still adjusting to life after more than 50 years of iron-gripped rule by the al-Assad family.
Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December after a lightning offensive by opposition rebels led by al-Sharaa’s forces.
Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Riyadh, described Trump’s promise to lift all sanctions and his meeting with al-Sharaa as significant developments.
“This is a massive breakthrough, giving the new authorities in Syria more legitimacy internationally,” our correspondent said.
He said Trump’s decision would likely also pave the way for the GCC to commit more financial aid to the authorities in Syria, noting that US sanctions had previously held them back from investing.
Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Damascus, said the meeting between Trump and al-Sharaa, which lasted for 33 minutes, was a major diplomatic breakthrough.
“For the first time in 25 years, a Syrian president has met with an American president. That in itself is very historic.”
While ties between the US and Syria are at an “all-time high”, our correspondent said that it would be “very, very difficult” for Damascus to agree on Trump’s demand for Syria to sign on to the Abraham Accords with Israel.
Speaking with leaders of the Gulf nations on Wednesday, Trump also said that he hopes to “make a deal” with Iran that would prevent that country from developing a nuclear weapon, but insisted that Iran would have to cease support for a network of armed groups throughout the region.
In talks before the Gulf Cooperation Council, Trump said that Iran “must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons”.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is also the lead negotiator for a potential nuclear deal with the United States, slammed Trump’s remarks as a “very deceitful viewpoint”.
“What he stated about the hope of regional nations for a progressive, flourishing path, is the same path that people of Iran decided through their revolution,” Araghchi said.
“It was the US that blocked progress of Iranian nation through sanctions for more than 40 years as well as its pressures, military and nonmilitary threats,” he added.
The Iranian foreign ministry stated on Wednesday that Iran will hold new talks with European powers later this week over efforts to limit Iran’s ability to build a nuclear weapon. The talks will take place in Istanbul, the capital of Turkiye, with the “E3” nations of Britain, France, and Germany in attendance.
Later on Wednesday, Trump travelled to Qatar’s capital Doha where a state visit with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was under way.
Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US during the visit.
While the precise details of the investments Qatar plans to announce were unclear, Qatar Airways was expected to announce a deal to buy about 100 wide-body jets from Boeing, according to the Reuters news agency.
Trump’s first two days of a four-day swing through the Gulf region have been marked by lavish ceremonies and business deals, including a $600bn commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142bn in US arms sales to the kingdom.
Following his visit to Qatar, Trump will fly to Abu Dhabi to meet leaders from the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.
He is then slated to fly back to Washington on Friday, but he has said he could fly to Turkiye instead for a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, amid efforts to halt the war in Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/trump-meets-syrias-al-sharaa-eyes-normalisation-of-ties-with-damascus
US & Canada,Uncategorized,Menendez brothers resentencing: What happened and could they be set free?,"On Tuesday, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. The brothers have spent 35 years in prison after they were arrested for killing their parents with a shotgun in 1989.
So what happened to the brothers, and could they be freed?
On August 20, 1989, Lyle, then 21 and Erik, then 18, fired multiple shotgun rounds at their parents, Jose Menendez and Mary “Kitty” Louise, in their Beverly Hills mansion, killing them. The brothers were arrested in 1990.
The brothers’ lawyers said that they were driven to murder because Jose had sexually abused them for years, and Kitty had enabled this behaviour while emotionally abusing them. Prosecutors, however, had argued that the intent behind the murders was malicious and that the brothers wanted to inherit their parents’ multimillion-dollar fortune. Jose worked as a music and film executive and was also the head of the successful record label RCA, which had signed artists such as Duran Duran.
A 1994 trial resulted in a hung jury. In 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole.
The case became fodder for American popular culture references, including in comedy dramas like Gilmore Girls and 30 Rock. A  new generation of Americans were introduced to the case last year with the release of the nine-part Netflix biopic called Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, which tried to depict the murders and the circumstances leading up to them from both the parents’ and the brothers’ perspectives. A separate documentary on the case was also released a month after the Netflix show.
Public calls for their release from the general public, their family members, alongside celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O’Donnell, grew louder, and a TikTok movement sprang up after the release of the show and documentary.
Currently, the brothers are being held at the Richard J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, California.
The brothers were resentenced under California’s youthful offender statute. This applies to those who have committed a crime under the age of 26 and it immediately makes them eligible for parole once they serve half of their term.
The resentencing was one of three possible paths to freedom sought by the brothers. The other two included clemency granted by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had ordered a parole board to assess whether the brothers would pose a danger to society; and a new trial, an option opposed by the office of Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. The brothers’ lawyers filed a motion in May 2023, detailing new evidence and seeking a new trial.
Judge Michael Jesic of Los Angeles Superior Court resentenced the Menendez brothers. This decision came after a daylong hearing where their family members testified before the court in favour of the brothers’ release.
While Jesic said that their crime was “horrific,” he said it was “amazing” how the brothers had rehabilitated themselves in prison. “It’s something I’ve never seen before,” Jesic said.
Anamaria Baralt, 54, the brothers’ first cousin, told the court on Tuesday that the brothers were “universally forgiven” by both sides of the family. “They are different men from the boys that they were when they committed these crimes,” Baralt said.
Other family members said the brothers should receive credit for their rehabilitation while in prison. They cited Green Space, Lyle’s 2018 prison beautification project, alongside the role Erik played in providing hospice care to fellow inmates.
Now 57 and 54 years old, Lyle and Erik addressed the court on Tuesday through videolink from the prison in San Diego and took responsibility for their actions. “My crime was not just criminal. It was wrong. It was immoral. It was cruel and it was vicious,” Erik said. “Today, 35 years later, I am deeply ashamed of who I was,” said Lyle.
However, prosecutor Habib Balian said he was not convinced by the family members’ testimonies and argued that the court could not be confident that the brothers would not commit another violent crime. “We know … what they are capable of doing,” he said.
In recent years, new evidence has emerged that defence lawyers argue substantiates claims of the brothers enduring sexual abuse at the hands of Jose.
This includes a letter Erik wrote to his cousin, detailing his father’s sexual abuse when he was 17 years old.
Additionally, Roy Rossello, who was a boy band member in the 1980s, publicly revealed that Jose sexually assaulted him in a 2023 documentary series on Peacock. Rossello’s band was called Menudo and the documentary series is called Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed.
The emergence of new evidence was a trigger for the brothers to explore new avenues to secure their release.
While the brothers were initially sentenced, back in 1996, without the possibility of parole, their new sentence allows for parole. This means that they can be released before their sentence is over.
Before they can be freed, they have to make a case for why they should be released before the state parole board. The brothers will remain imprisoned until then, and it is now up to the state parole board and California Governor Newsom to decide their fate.
Lyle and Erik will appear on June 13 before the parole board for the risk assessment report that Newsom ordered to help his clemency decision. If the board does approve their release, Newsom needs to sign off on that.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/menendez-brothers-resentencing-what-happened-and-could-they-be-set-free

US & Canada,Uncategorized,Topuria to fight Oliveira at UFC 317 after Makhachev vacates title,"Ilia Topuria will look to add a second Ultimate Fighting Championship belt to his collection when he headlines UFC 317 on June 28 – it just won’t be against Islam Makhachev.
After weeks of heightened anticipation for a potential blockbuster face-off between the superstar pair, Topuria, a former undisputed featherweight champ, will now fight former champion Charles Oliveira for the vacant lightweight title, UFC CEO Dana White announced on Tuesday.
Makhachev, a four-time defending champion, will vacate the lightweight belt to move up to welterweight to face newly crowned Jack Della Maddalena, who defeated Belal Muhammad last Saturday at UFC 315 to become the new title holder in the weight class. The date for that fight has yet to be announced.
Topuria has a perfect UFC record of 16-0. The Spaniard relinquished his 145-pound (66kg) featherweight title earlier this year in anticipation of a lightweight title showdown against Makhachev and took to social media to voice his displeasure at the Russian vacating his title belt.
“On June 29, another dream will come true,” Topuria wrote. “I’ll be the champion of the lightweight division. Charles [Oliveira], my apologies in advance… I’m just fighting for my dreams. It’s unfortunate that Makhachev ran away.”
Makhachev, who sports a 27-1 UFC record, is ranked by ESPN as the best pound-for-pound UFC fighter in the world; Topuria is ranked number two.

US & Canada,Uncategorized,Wisconsin judge indicted on allegations she helped man evade ICE agents,"A judge in the United States has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings after she was accused of helping an undocumented migrant evade authorities.
Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, 66, was arrested last month after prosecutors said she hindered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who showed up to arrest the man without a judicial warrant outside her courtroom.
Prosecutors alleged she tried to help Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer leave the courtroom from the back jury door before his arrest outside the building.
Dugan faces up to six years in prison if she’s convicted on both counts. Craig Mastantuono, one of Dugan’s lawyers, said in a statement that Dugan “asserts her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court”.
Dugan, who was elected in 2016, is expected to plead not guilty at the next hearing scheduled for Thursday.
According to court documents, ​​Flores-Ruiz had illegally re-entered the US after being deported in 2013.
According to online state court records, he was charged with three counts of misdemeanour domestic abuse in Milwaukee County in March, to which he was in court in April for a hearing.
Court documents suggest Dugan was alerted that the immigration agents appeared in the court’s hallway by her clerk.
In an affidavit, Dugan was described as visibly angry over their arrival and called the situation “absurd” before leaving the bench and returning to her chambers.
She and another judge later approached the ICE agents in the court with what witnesses described as a “confrontational, angry demeanour”.
After a back-and-forth over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom, according to the affidavit.
When she returned to the courtroom, she was heard telling Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer to come with her, and they were ushered out through a back jury door.
Flores-Ruiz was later captured by federal agents outside the court after a foot chase.
The indictment is the latest incident in President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration and local authorities.

US & Canada,Politics,Trump administration cuts another $450m in Harvard grants in escalating row,"The administration of United States President Donald Trump has slashed another $450m in grants from Harvard University, amid an ongoing feud over anti-Semitism, presidential control and the limits of academic freedom.
On Tuesday, a joint task force assembled under Trump accused Harvard, the country’s oldest university, of perpetrating a “long-standing policy and practice of discriminating on the basis of race”.
“Harvard’s campus, once a symbol of academic prestige, has become a breeding ground for virtue signaling and discrimination. This is not leadership; it is cowardice. And it’s not academic freedom; it’s institutional disenfranchisement,” the task force said in a statement.
“By prioritizing appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school’s claim to taxpayer support.”
The elimination of another $450m in grants came in addition to the more than $2.2bn in federal funds that were already suspended last week, the task force added.
The feud between the president and Harvard – a prestigious Ivy League campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts – began in March, when Trump sought to impose new rules and regulations on top schools that had played host to pro-Palestinian protests over the last year.
Trump has called such protests “illegal” and accused participants of anti-Semitism. But student protest leaders have described their actions as a peaceful response to Israel’s war in Gaza, which has elicited concerns about human rights abuses, including genocide.
Columbia University was initially a centrepiece of the Trump administration’s efforts. The New York City school had seen the first major Palestine solidarity encampment rise on its lawn, which served as a blueprint for similar protests around the world. It also saw a series of mass arrests in the aftermath.
In March, one of Columbia’s protest leaders, Mahmoud Khalil, was the first foreign student to be arrested and have his legal immigration status revoked under Trump’s campaign to punish demonstrators. And when Trump threatened to yank $400m in grants and research contracts, the school agreed to submit to a list of demands to restore the funding.
The demands included adopting a formal definition of anti-Semitism, beefing up campus security and putting one of its academic departments – focused on Middle East, African and South Asian studies – under the supervision of an outside authority.
Free speech advocates called Columbia’s concessions a capitulation to Trump, who they say has sought to erode academic freedom and silence viewpoints he disagrees with.
On April 11, his administration issued another list of demands for Harvard that went even further. Under its terms, Harvard would have had to revamp its disciplinary system, eliminate its diversity initiatives and agree to an external audit of programmes deemed anti-Semitic.
The demands also required Harvard to agree to “structural and personnel changes” that would foster “viewpoint diversity” – a term left ambiguous. But critics argued it was a means for Trump to impose his values and priorities on the school by shaping its hiring and admissions practices.
Harvard has been at the centre of controversies surrounding its admissions in the past. In 2023, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled that Harvard’s consideration of race in student admissions – through a process called affirmative action – violated the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution.
Tuesday’s letter referenced that court decision in arguing that “Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus”.
A pair of reports in April, created by Harvard University’s own task forces, also found that there were cases of anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish violence on campus in the wake of Israel’s war in Gaza, a divisive issue in US politics.
Ultimately, on April 14, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, rejected the Trump administration’s demands, arguing they were evidence of government overreach.
“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber wrote in his response.
But Trump has continued to pressure the campus, including by threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status. Democrats and other critics have warned that it would be illegal for the president to influence the decisions of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with regard to individual taxpayers, like the university.
Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has also threatened to bar foreign students from enrolling at the university if Harvard did not hand over documents pertaining to the pro-Palestine protests.
On Monday, Garber, Harvard’s president, wrote a response to Trump’s secretary of education, Linda McMahon, defending his campus’s commitment to free speech while also addressing the spectre of anti-Semitism.
“We share common ground on a number of critical issues, including the importance of ending antisemitism and other bigotry on campus. Like you, I believe that Harvard must foster an academic environment that encourages freedom of thought and expression, and that we should embrace a multiplicity of viewpoints,” his letter read.
But, he added, Harvard’s efforts to create a more equitable learning environment were “undermined and threatened” by the Trump administration’s “overreach”.
“Harvard will not surrender its core, legally-protected principles out of fear of unfounded retaliation by the federal government,” Garber said.
“I must refute your claim that Harvard is a partisan institution. It is neither Republican nor Democratic. It is not an arm of any other political party or movement. Nor will it ever be.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/trump-administration-cuts-another-450m-in-harvard-grants-in-escalating-row
US & Canada,Politics,US decision to lift sanctions on Syria: Here’s what you need to know,"United States President Donald Trump has announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted, in a huge boost to the government in Damascus, which took power after the overthrow of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.
“There’s a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilising the country and keeping peace,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, the first of a three-day visit to the Middle East, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness.”
Trump is also expected to meet Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Riyadh on Wednesday, in a further signal to the world that the international isolation of Syria should end.
In Syria, the news has been met with celebrations in the capital, Damascus, and elsewhere. There is hope the move will help turn around the country’s economy after more than a decade of war.
Let’s take a closer look.
The US was just one of many countries that had placed sanctions on Syria during the former al-Assad regime, which governed the country from 1971 to 2024.
The US sanctions were wide-ranging. The US initially designated Syria a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, which led to an arms embargo and financial restrictions, including on foreign assistance.
Further sanctions were imposed in 2004, including more arms export restrictions and limits on Syria’s economic interactions with the US.
After the war in Syria began in 2011, and al-Assad’s regime started attacking civilian antigovernment protesters, numerous other wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Syria and regime-linked individuals. This included a freeze on Syrian government assets held abroad, a ban on US investments in Syria and restrictions on petroleum imports.
The US had also announced a $10m reward for the capture of Syria’s current leader, al-Sharaa, and listed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the organisation he ran before its dissolution with the fall of al-Assad, as a “Foreign Terrorist Organization”.
The main tranche of sanctions was imposed during the early years of Syria’s war, when the US was supporting the country’s opposition and attempting to isolate the al-Assad regime, pointing to its human rights abuses, including the use of chemical weapons.
The “terrorist” designation placed on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham was a result of its former association with al-Qaeda. This was one of the reasons there has been international wariness to remove sanctions on Syria even after the fall of al-Assad.
Al-Sharaa has slowly been gaining international legitimacy for his government since it came to power in December. The US had already removed the reward for his capture, and the Syrian president has been able to travel internationally and meet world leaders, including in Saudi Arabia and France.
The new Syrian government has made a concerted effort to present itself as a moderate force that could be acceptable to the international community, including by distancing itself from designated “terrorist” groups, promising to cooperate with other countries on “counterterrorism” efforts and making statements supporting minority rights. The latter has been particularly important in light of sectarian fighting involving pro-government forces and minority groups after the fall of al-Assad.
The Reuters news agency also reported this week that Syria has attempted to convince the US that it is not a threat but a potential partner, including by saying it was engaged in indirect talks with Israel to deescalate tensions with the US’s Middle eastern ally – despite Israel’s bombing of Syria and occupation of its territory. There had also been talk of US-Syria business deals, even including a Trump Tower in Damascus.
Trump on Tuesday said that his decision to end the sanctions came after discussions with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“Oh, what I do for the crown prince!” he said.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said that US relationships with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE – all countries that had been pushing for an end to sanctions and support for the new Syrian government – had been an integral part of Trump’s decision.
“This wasn’t something that was too difficult for Trump to do,” Rahman said. “He didn’t need to get permission from anybody. He didn’t even need consent from Congress.”
Because of the central role the US plays in the global financial system, the lifting of sanctions is a signal to the world that it can do business in Syria.
The sanctions had been economically debilitating for Syria, and presented a huge impediment for the new government, which is under pressure to improve living standards in a country where unemployment and poverty levels are high, and electricity blackouts are common.
Whether the US itself invests in Syria remains to be seen, but increased Arab and Turkish investment is likely.
“[The removal of sanctions] takes away a key obstacle in [Syria’s] ability to establish some kind of economic development, economic prosperity,” Rahman told Al Jazeera. “But there are plenty of other obstacles and challenges the country is facing.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/us-decision-to-lift-sanctions-on-syria-heres-what-you-need-to-know
US & Canada,Politics,Israel ‘normalisation’ takes back seat as Trump announces Saudi deals,"Washington, DC – United States President Donald Trump says that forging formal relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel would be a “dream”, but he wants the kingdom to do it on its “own time”.
The White House on Tuesday made public a flurry of economic and defence pacts with Saudi Arabia involving hundreds of billions of dollars, but any mention of Israel was conspicuously absent from the announcements.
The so-called “normalisation” drive between Saudi Arabia and Israel dominated his predecessor, Joe Biden’s, approach to the region, but the current US president is shifting focus elsewhere, analysts say.
“The Trump administration has made it clear they are willing to move forward on key agreements with Saudi Arabia without the previous condition of Saudi-Israel normalisation,” said Anna Jacobs, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank.
“This probably reflects growing frustration in the Trump administration with Israeli military action across the region, especially in Gaza.”
Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, fellow for the Middle East at the Baker Institute, also said that Trump has realised that with the ongoing war in Gaza and Israel’s refusal to negotiate the establishment of a Palestinian state, the “time is not right” for a Saudi Arabia-Israeli pact despite Biden’s emphasis on brokering a deal.
“I think the White House has finally acknowledged that a normalisation agreement at this time is not possible,” Coates Ulrichsen told Al Jazeera.
During his first term, Trump managed to broker the Abraham Accords between Israel and several Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, which established formal relations with the US ally independently of the Palestinian issue.
However, the agreements were unsuccessful in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as evidenced by the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023.
But even before the war started, Israel had been intensifying its military raids against Palestinians and expanding illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, further dimming the prospects of a two-state solution to the conflict.
Despite the agreements’ apparent shortcomings, Biden made adding Saudi Arabia to the Abraham Accords a focal point of his Middle East agenda, and US officials said they worked on securing a deal up until the final days of the administration, even as the war on Gaza was raging.
Biden has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that Hamas launched its October 7 attack against Israel in 2023 to thwart an agreement between the Saudis and Israelis.
Still, a day before he left office, Biden boasted that his Middle East policies created an opportunity for “the future of normalisation and integration of Israel with all its Arab neighbours, including Saudi Arabia”.
US officials and media reports said that Biden’s deal, which never materialised, would have brought a security pact between Riyadh and Washington and provided US help for Saudi Arabia to establish a civil nuclear programme in exchange for normalisation with Israel.
A major sticking point in that push has been the widely stated Saudi Arabian support for the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which conditions recognition of Israel on the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has categorically rejected the “land for peace” framework, pushing instead for deals with Arab countries that bypass Palestinians.
“This Israeli government won’t even provide lip service to the idea of a two-state solution, making it pretty impossible for Saudi Arabia to seriously consider moving forward with normalisation,” said Jacobs from the Arab Gulf States Institute.
“The Trump administration seems to have understood that it’s off the table, at least for now.”
In Riyadh, Trump announced an agreement to deepen security cooperation with Saudi Arabia.
The $142bn deal will provide Saudi Arabia with “state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services” from US firms, the White House said.
It also includes “extensive training and support to build the capacity of the Saudi armed forces, including enhancement of Saudi service academies and military medical services”, it added.
While the weapons and training deals fall short of a NATO-like mutual defence pact, which may have been included as part of an accord with Israel, they take a bite from the US-backed carrots offered to the kingdom for normalisation, experts say.
“The announcements today do further deepen the links between Saudi and US security and defence interests,” Coates Ulrichsen said.
Trump’s visit to the region comes as Israel has promised to not just continue, but expand, its devastating war on Gaza, which has killed more than 52,900 Palestinians, according to health authorities.
Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, noted that Riyadh has described Israeli atrocities in Gaza as a “genocide”.
“The Saudis are not mincing their words; they are not holding back,” Elgindy told Al Jazeera. “They can’t now move toward normalisation with Israel after accusing Israel of genocide. That would just be ridiculous.”
After his trip to Saudi Arabia, Trump will head to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as part of the first planned foreign trips of his presidency, since attending Pope Francis’s funeral last month. Israel is not on the itinerary.
For Coates Ulrichsen and others, Trump’s apparent snub of Israel reflects unease in the US-Israeli alliance.
“It may be a signal that the White House sees much more value in deepening commercial and strategic relationships with the Gulf states at the moment, given that Israel remains mired in conflict,” Coates Ulrichsen told Al Jazeera.
Tensions between the Trump administration and Netanyahu’s government have become more apparent in recent weeks despite the US’s military and diplomatic backing of Israel.
Trump confirmed talks with Iran over its nuclear programme during Netanyahu’s visit to the White House, despite the Israeli leader’s opposition to negotiations with Tehran.
Last week, the US president also declared a ceasefire with the Houthis. The deal did not demand an end to the Yemeni group’s attacks against Israel.
As Trump spoke in Riyadh on Tuesday, the Houthis fired another missile at Israel – part of a campaign they say aims to pressure an end to the war on Gaza.
The Trump administration also worked with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to secure the release of US citizen Edan Alexander, who served in the Israeli military and was captured by Hamas during the October 7 attack on Israel. According to Israeli media reports, Israel was excluded from those talks.
Elgindy from Georgetown University said the apparent tensions are more than a “bump in the road”, but their impact on the US-Israeli relationship remains to be seen.
“Trump is making clear in word and deed that US and Israeli interests are not one and the same,” he said. “And that’s very significant because Biden didn’t do that.”
For now, Trump remains committed to US military aid to Israel even as it intensifies its bombardment and starvation campaign in Gaza.
And the US president has pushed on with his crackdown on critics of Israel at home, especially on college campuses.
Still, experts say that by skipping Israel during his Middle East trip and de-prioritising normalisation, Trump is pushing forward in pursuit of his own vision for the region.
On Tuesday, Trump lauded Gulf leaders whom he said are building a Middle East “where people of different nations, religions and creeds are building cities together – not bombing each other out of existence”.
That future seems at odds with what Israel appears to be seeking: asserting hegemony over the region with long-term bombing campaigns, including in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.
“A very strong signal is being sent that a stable, prosperous Middle East – represented, in the administration’s views, by the Gulf states – is a much more desirable outcome than maybe the Israeli view of the Middle East at the moment, which is one of seemingly escalating a forever conflict,” said Coates Ulrichsen.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/israel-normalisation-takes-backseat-as-trump-announces-saudi-deals

Latin America,Politics,Kremlin declines to say if Putin will meet Ukraine’s Zelenskyy in Istanbul,"The Kremlin has again declined to say whether President Vladimir Putin will travel to Turkiye for planned negotiations with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, amid growing international pressure on Moscow to hold direct talks and end its three-year war.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that Moscow would disclose the makeup of its delegation to Turkiye once Putin gave the order.
“The Russian delegation will be waiting for the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul on May 15,” he said.
Peskov said he would provide an update “when we get the relevant instructions from the president”.
“No such instructions have been received yet.”
The planned negotiations, expected to take place on Thursday in Istanbul, Turkiye’s commercial hub, would be the first direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow since 2022, shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour.
Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Turkiye where he said he would hold talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on either Wednesday or Thursday.
The Ukrainian leader has challenged Putin to meet him in Turkiye, saying if he does not show up, it would show that Moscow is not interested in peace.
He also urged United States President Donald Trump, currently on a tour of Middle Eastern countries, to visit Turkiye and participate in the talks.
Trump on Wednesday said there was a “possibility” he would head to Turkiye for talks on Ukraine if Putin also travelled there.
“I don’t know that he (Putin) would be there if I’m not there,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he flew from Saudi Arabia to Qatar.
“I know he would like me to be there, and that’s a possibility. If we could end the war, I’d be thinking about that,” he said.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is already set to travel to Istanbul on Friday.
“Marco is going and Marco has been very effective,” Trump said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged to press Putin to attend negotiations with Zelenskyy in Turkiye.
Lula is expected to stop in the Russian capital on the way back from attending a regional forum in China.
“I’ll try to talk to Putin,” Lula said at a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday before his departure.
“It costs me nothing to say, ‘hey, comrade Putin, go to Istanbul and negotiate, dammit,'” he said.
Lula’s comments come after the Ukrainian foreign minister urged Brazil to use its influence with Russia to secure a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy.
Brazil and China issued a joint statement on Tuesday calling for direct negotiations as the “only way to end the conflict”.
Peskov also condemned comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron that Paris was open to deploying nuclear-armed warplanes in other European countries.
On Tuesday, Macron told France’s TF1 television that nuclear arms proliferation would not enhance the continent’s security.
“The Americans have the bombs on planes in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Turkiye,” he said, adding, “We are ready to open this discussion. I will define the framework in a very specific way in the weeks and months to come.”
With France as the European Union’s only nuclear-armed nation, discussion to place bombers in other countries across the bloc is growing after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/brazils-lula-urges-russias-putin-to-go-to-istanbul-and-negotiate
Latin America,Politics,"Uruguay’s Jose Mujica, a president famed for sparse living, dead at 89","Jose “Pepe” Mujica, a former leftist rebel who became Uruguay’s president from 2010 to 2015, has died at the age of 89.
Uruguayan President Yamandu Orsi announced his death in a social media post on Tuesday. Mujica had been diagnosed with throat cancer in 2024.
“It is with deep sorrow that we announce the death of our comrade Pepe Mujica,” Orsi wrote. “Thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people.”
Mujica became an icon even beyond Uruguay’s borders, as he led his country to pursue environmental reforms, legalise same-sex marriage and loosen restrictions on marijuana.
He also was celebrated for maintaining his simple lifestyle even during his presidency, when he eschewed the presidential palace in favour of the farmhouse where he grew flowers. He told Al Jazeera in 2022 that such opulence can “divorce” presidents from their people.
“I believe that politicians should live like the majority of their people, not like how the privileged minority lives,” Mujica explained.
News of Mujica’s death has been met with tributes from around the world, particularly from figures on the Latin American left.
“We deeply regret the passing of our beloved Pepe Mujica, an example to Latin America and the entire world for his wisdom, foresight, and simplicity,” Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote on social media.
Chile’s President Gabriel Boric, meanwhile, remembered Mujica’s optimism in a post of his own.
“If you left us anything, it was the unquenchable hope that things can be done better,” he wrote.
For his part, Colombian President Gustavo Petro offered a tribute to Mujica that doubled as a call for greater collaboration and integration across Latin America.
“Goodbye, friend,” Petro wrote in the wake of Mujica’s passing, as he envisioned a more unified region. “I hope that Latin America will one day have an anthem.”
Mujica became a symbol to a generation of political leaders helping to steer their countries out of military dictatorships during the latter half of the 20th century. Like Petro, Mujica was likewise a former rebel fighter.
As a young man in the 1960s, he led armed fighters as part of the far-left Tupamaros movement, which was known for robbing banks, taking over towns and even exchanging gunfire with local police.
Mujica was arrested multiple times and spent nearly a decade in solitary confinement, in a prison where he endured torture.
A government crackdown on the left-wing fighters helped pave the way for a coup in 1973, followed by a brutal military dictatorship that perpetrated human rights abuses like forced disappearances. But in 1985, Uruguay began its transition to democracy, and Mujica and other rebel fighters were released under an amnesty law.
He started to become a force in Uruguay’s politics, joining the Frente Amplio or Broad Front, a centre-left coalition with other former fighters.
After he was elected president at age 74, Mujica staked out progressive stances on civil liberties and social issues including abortion and gay marriage, and he even pushed for the legalisation of marijuana. He also emphasised the development of green energy practices, putting Uruguay at the forefront of addressing the climate crisis.
His long-term partner Lucia Topolansky, whom he met during his time with the Tupamaros, was also politically active, and she served as his vice president after they were married in 2005.
While president, Mujica famously shunned the presidential residence and remained at his flower farm on the outskirts of the capital of Montevideo. He also drove a weathered blue Volkswagen Beetle, one of his trademarks. His modest lifestyle led some to dub him the “world’s poorest president”.
“We elect a president, and it’s as if they’re a candidate to be king, someone with a court, a red carpet, who has to live in a fancy palace,” he told Al Jazeera in 2022, before adding with characteristic bluntness: “Don’t blame the pig, but those who scratch his back.”
Mujica remained a prominent public figure even after leaving the presidency, attending the inauguration of political leaders across Latin America and offering support to candidates in Uruguay, among them Orsi, who was elected in 2024.
“The problem is that the world is run by old people, who forget what they were like when they were young,” Mujica said during a 2024 interview with the news agency Reuters.
Mujica was informed in September 2024 that radiation treatment had effectively targeted cancer of the esophagus, but a doctor reported in January 2025 that the cancer had returned and spread to his liver.
The former rebel and president did not seem overly concerned.

Latin America,Uncategorized,Argentina’s top court finds Nazi files ‘of global significance’ in basement,"More than 80 boxes filled with documents from Nazi Germany have been discovered in the basement of Argentina’s Supreme Court, decades after the crates were stashed in 1941.
The “discovery of global significance” came as workers were clearing out the area in preparation for transferring the archives to a newly-established museum, the court said in a statement on Monday.
The 83 boxes were sent by the German embassy in Japan’s capital Tokyo to Argentina in June 1941 on board the Japanese steamship “Nan-a-Maru”, the court statement said.
At the time, German diplomats in Argentina claimed they contained personal effects, but the shipment was held up by customs and became the subject of a probe by a special commission on “anti-Argentine activities”. A judge later ordered the seizure of the materials, and the matter ended up before the Supreme Court, which took possession of the crates.
About 84 years later, upon opening one of the boxes, the court identified material “intended to consolidate and propagate Adolf Hitler’s ideology in Argentina during the Second World War”.
The rest of the boxes were opened last Friday in the presence of the chief rabbi of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) and officials of the Buenos Aires Holocaust Museum.
“Given the historical relevance of the find and the potential crucial information it could contain to clarify events related to the Holocaust, the president of the Supreme Court, Horacio Rosatti, ordered an exhaustive survey of all the material found,” the court said.
“The main objective is to … determine if the material contains crucial information about the Holocaust and if any clues found can shed light on aspects still unknown, such as the route of Nazi money at a global level,” it added.
The court has transferred the boxes to a room equipped with extra security measures and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to participate in their preservation and inventory.
Experts will examine them for any clues about still-unknown aspects of the Holocaust, such as international financing networks used by the Nazis.
Argentina remained neutral in World War II until 1944. The South American country declared war on Germany and Japan the following year. From 1933 to 1954, according to the Holocaust Museum, 40,000 Jews entered Argentina as they fled Nazi persecution in Europe.
But after World War II, Argentina, led by President Juan Peron, became a haven for several high-ranking Nazi officials.
They included Adolf Eichmann, who was considered a key architect of Hitler’s plan to exterminate Europe’s Jews. He was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960 and taken to Israel, where he was tried and executed.
Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, too, hid away in Argentina before fleeing to Paraguay and later Brazil, where he died.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/argentinas-top-court-uncovers-80-boxes-of-nazi-propaganda
Latin America,Uncategorized,Who is Pope Leo XIV?,,https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/
Latin America,Uncategorized,‘Leone!’ Vatican crowds hail Leo XIV as new pope of the Catholic Church,"Vatican City – It felt like the square could talk in one voice: “Leone! Leone! Leone!”
Thousands of people in St Peter’s Square chanted in chorus the name adopted by Robert Prevost as he ascended to the papacy on Thursday: Leo XIV.
Just an hour and a half earlier, white smoke had billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, announcing that a conclave of cardinals had elected a new leader for the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.
Now, it was time to meet Pope Leo himself. A solemn silence fell across the square. The faithful waited to hear the pope’s first message, which would set the tone for his papacy.
“Peace be upon you,” said Leo XIV, appearing on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica.
He proceeded to repeat a blessing uttered by his late predecessor, Pope Francis, just weeks earlier: “God loves us, God loves everyone, and evil will not prevail. We are in the hands of God.”
It was a closely watched moment, with red-hatted cardinals poking out of nearby windows to catch their first glimpse at the newly minted pontiff.
Pope Leo XIV was elected on the second day of the conclave, and his opening remarks as leader signalled continuity with Francis, who died on April 21 at age 88. But experts say he is likely to strike a middle path, between furthering Francis’s inclusive agenda and embracing Vatican tradition.
“Peace” was one of the most used words in his brief speech — a choice meant to echo the words that Jesus pronounced after Easter, as Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni explained during a news briefing.
Leo XIV called on Catholics to seek “a disarmed peace and a disarming peace” through “dialogue” and “building bridges”, in a brief speech heavy with themes of unity.
“Bravo! That is what we need!” one audience member in the square shouted as the new pope spoke.
Another, 29-year-old Kasper Mihalak from Denmark, was squeezed in the middle of the crowd hoping to catch a glimpse of the first North American pope.
“I am really excited. Cardinal Prevost, now Leo XIV — it’s gonna be amazing! He said a lot about peace during his speech. I think the world now really needs it,” Mihalak said.
Rosaria Venuto could hardly hold back her tears. Early in the morning, she picked up her two children and drove four hours from Ascoli Satriano, a small town in the southern Italian province of Apulia, to be in St Peter’s Square.
“I am deeply moved to have the chance to be here and live through this joy and be a small part of this historical event,” she said.
Born in Chicago, a midwestern city in the United States, Leo XIV spent more than two decades in Peru, where he acquired dual citizenship.
There, he worked in some of Peru’s poorest areas, and he eventually became the bishop of Chiclayo, in the country’s agricultural north. Then, in 2023, Pope Francis appointed him to lead a powerful office that manages bishops across the world.
Phil Pullella, a Vatican expert who has covered the papacy for more than four decades, said that background offers a degree of continuity with Francis, who hailed from Argentina and advocated against poverty.
“He knows about poverty in Latin America,” Pullella said of Leo XIV. “So, he’s not the same thing as if they had elected some cardinal of New York, for example.”
That continuity was likely appreciated by conservative camps at the Vatican, as well as liberal-leaning ones, Pullella added.
“He comes from the wealthy world, but he witnessed firsthand the problems of the Global South in a poor country,” he said.
Still, Pullella noted that the way Leo XIV dressed showed that “he is going to be his own man”.
Instead of the simple white cassock that Pope Francis wore in 2013 when he was elected, Leo XIII added a traditional red cape over his vest, symbolising the spiritual and temporal powers of his office.
“In a sense, he is going back a little bit to that kind of tradition,” Pullella said. “He would not have been elected had he not had the votes of the conservative bloc.”
Leo XIV’s election came as a surprise to many. Many observers were betting on a new pope by nightfall, but few expected only three rounds of voting.
The crowd was stunned when white smoke started to pour out of the tiny chimney by early evening, at around 6:09pm local time (16:00 GMT).
That was the signal that — of the 133 cardinals under the age of 80 who were eligible to vote — a candidate had received the two-thirds majority needed to become pope.
This year’s conclave had the distinction of being the most international in the Vatican’s history: The participating cardinals hailed from more than 70 countries, representing divergent views for the Catholic Church’s future.
The diversity was part of the legacy of Pope Francis, who appointed cardinals from underrepresented countries like Laos and Haiti to broaden the church’s global appeal.
Francis spent 12 years as head of the Catholic Church, shaking up the establishment by adopting a distinct style and tone, focused on austerity and advocacy for marginalised populations.
The late pope’s efforts caused excitement among reformers but also dismay among conservatives, who accused him of diluting the Church’s teachings. Experts say that led to a deep polarisation within the church, with some members criticising Francis for decentralising the church’s authority.
Those experts point out that Leo XIV’s experience in the Roman Curia — the church’s government — was likely a selling point among conservative conclave voters looking for stability in the years ahead.
While Pope Leo XIV’s first moves are yet to be revealed, his choice of name is noteworthy.
Bruni, the Vatican spokesperson, noted that “Leo” is a direct reference to Pope Leo XIII, who adopted a new social doctrine in the late 19th century.
In 1891, Pope Leo XIII wrote an encyclical — or papal letter — known as the Rerum Novarum. It called on Catholics to address the “wretchedness” facing the working class, amid the upheavals of industrialisation and political changes like the unification of Italy.
That encyclical marked a radical new approach to workers, and it triggered the creation of Catholic newspapers, social cooperatives and banks — a social movement that is still alive today.
Bruni said the current Pope Leo hoped to draw a parallel to that time, with its technological revolutions.
“It is not a casual reference to the men and women of their work at a time of artificial intelligence,” Bruni explained.
Robert Orsi, a professor of religious studies at Northwestern University, said the name choice could also signify other historical parallels.
Leo XIII “strongly put down a movement called Americanism,” said Orsi.
“This movement was a kind of nationalist impulse within Catholicism, with national churches claiming to have their own identities, their own particular ways of doing things,” he explained. “And I think by choosing the name Leo XIV, this pope was, without a doubt, signalling a return to a global Catholicism.”
Pullella also believes it is noteworthy that, while Leo XIV mentioned his parishioners in Peru, he avoided highlighting his ties with the US.
“I think it’s very significant that he did not give a shout-out to the United States. He didn’t say, ‘I’m from America.’ He didn’t speak in English,” Pullella said.
That sent a message that “basically he’s not owned by the United States”, Pullella added. Leo XIV has previously been critical of the administration of US President Donald Trump over issues like nationalism and migration, just as the late Pope Francis was.
Still, Orsi predicted the Vatican under the new Pope Leo would be “subtle and wise” in how he deals with Trump in the years to come.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/9/leone-vatican-crowds-hail-leo-xiv-as-new-pope-of-the-catholic-church
Latin America,Politics,Ford to raise prices on three cars produced in Mexico: RPT,"Ford Motor Company has raised prices for three of its vehicles produced in Mexico, becoming one of the first major carmakers to adjust sticker prices following US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The new prices took effect on vehicles produced on May 2 or later, according to the news agency Reuters, which first reported the story on Wednesday.
Prices on the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up — one of its most affordable and popular vehicles— and Bronco Sport will increase by as much as $2,000 on some models, according to a notice sent to dealers, which was reviewed by Reuters.  A Ford spokesperson said the cars with the raised price tag would arrive at dealer lots in late June.
Ford said the trade war would add about $2.5bn in costs for 2025, but it expects to reduce that exposure by about $1bn. General Motors said last week that tariffs were projected to cost it between $4bn and $5bn following the imposition of hefty levies on foreign imports of automobiles, but it expected to offset that by at least 30 percent.
Trump’s tariffs have unleashed weeks of uncertainty across the auto sector, as major carmakers in the United States and Europe have pulled forecasts, shifted production and caused companies to idle plants.
Following weeks of pushback from the auto industry, Trump softened his tariffs on foreign auto parts imports to give carmakers credits for what is produced in the US and to avoid double-tariffs on raw materials used in production. However, the White House has not rescinded a 25-percent tariff on the 8 million vehicles the US imports annually.
Ford is in a better position to weather tariffs than some of its competitors because of its strong US manufacturing base. The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker assembles 79 percent of its US-sold vehicles domestically, compared with GM’s 53 percent, according to an analyst note from Barclays.
Ford and GM also face significant levies on imports from China and South Korea, respectively. GM estimated that the costs on its Korean imports totalled about $2bn, while Ford declined to specify the expenses around importing vehicles from China.
Automakers that rely on exports to the US are facing increased pricing pressure. A dozen major carmakers, including Toyota and GM, import at least 40 percent of the vehicles they sell in the US, with some, such as Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor, importing more than 60 percent, according to 2024 data from S&P Global Mobility.
Before Ford’s move, most carmakers had not taken the step of boosting prices, but had warned that it was on the way. Porsche said it would have to boost its selling cost if tariffs remained in place, while US Volkswagen’s Audi brand also suggested potential price increases, without providing any details.
By contrast, BMW expects US car tariffs to decline from July, based on its contacts with US officials – a more upbeat assessment of the trade climate than many rivals. GM’s finance chief, Paul Jacobson, told analysts last week that the automaker was not expecting imminent price increases, saying they “feel good about where the pricing environment is today”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/7/ford-to-raise-prices-on-three-cars-produced-in-mexico-report
Latin America,Uncategorized,Women in the Catholic Church: Which way will the next pope go?,"Rome, Italy – When Pope Francis was elected in 2013, he faced loud calls to expand the role of women within the Roman Catholic Church.
To some extent, he delivered. Francis opened key meetings to women; allowed them to senior roles within the powerful central bureaucracy of the Church; and appointed the first female head of the Vatican governorate. For some, these were giant strides for a deeply conservative institution. But to many others, Francis’s moves fell short of what was needed to make the Church truly inclusive.
Now, as cardinals hold daily meetings before beginning the process of voting following his death on April 21, the role of women in the Church remains a divisive issue. When the cardinals finally emerge from their cocoon in the Vatican, will they have picked a pope who will build on Francis’s changes — or someone who might roll them back?
“Women are not holding their breath,” said Kate McElwee, the executive director of Women’s Ordination Conference, a nonprofit focused on women’s rights within Church institutions. “There is some anxiety on whether the next papacy will see some backsliding on the progress because there is a real desire for the project of [women’s] inclusion to continue.”
Francis’s legacy, when it comes to women in the Church, is still up for debate.
He gave women the power to vote on issues related to the Church at the Synod of Bishops. He also appointed a dozen women to high-ranking positions, including Barbara Jatta as the director of the Vatican Museums, Sister Raffaella Petrini as the president of the powerful Vatican City State, and Sister Simona Brambilla as the first female prefect of a Vatican office overseeing religious orders for both men and women. Overall, throughout Pope Francis’s papacy, the presence of women in the Church’s workforce rose from about 19 percent to 23.4 percent, according to Vatican figures.
But to some, these were just cosmetic changes. The pope did not move forward on the polarising issue of women’s ordination, particularly as deacons or priests.
In the Catholic Church, the role of a deacon involves certain religious functions, such as assisting during mass and performing baptism, but does not allow carrying out most sacraments.
Pope Francis set up two commissions – the first in 2016 and the second in 2020 – to consider whether women could serve as deacons by studying if that was the case in the early centuries of the Church. The report produced by the first group was never released to the public as the commission was not able to agree on the issue, according to Francis, while the second never concluded its work. In 2024, during an interview with US broadcaster CBS, Pope Francis gave a flat “no” to the ordination of women deacons. But a few months later, he signed off on the final document of a synod, saying the issue should remain an “open” question.
“It feels like he unlocked the door but didn’t fully open it,” McElwee said.
And as for women becoming priests, Pope John Paul II in 1994 issued a ban that has since been repeatedly reaffirmed.
That underrepresentation is in stark display these days as members of an all-male body are discussing the fate of the Church. At pre-conclave meetings in Rome, cardinals are discussing what they believe are the core issues and priorities that a future pope should be able to tackle – from the Church’s sexual and financial scandals and the global crisis of faith to the ties with China and the importance of canon law.
Most of the cardinals who will vote for the new pontiff inside the Sistine Chapel this week have been appointed by Pope Francis and are aligned with many aspects of his agenda, such as social justice, migration and climate change. Yet, observers say they have not spelled out their positions on women in the Church clearly.
In 2023, Cardinal Anders Arborelius, the bishop of Stockholm, Sweden, said it was “important to see that there are other ways” for women to serve the Church “than ordained ministry”. And in a speech at a pre-conclave meeting this week, Beniamino Stella, an Italian cardinal seen as close to the late pope, surprised fellow clergymen by accusing Francis of having created “chaos” in the Church by opening the governance of Vatican offices to men and women who were not part of the clergy.
Sister Marie, a nun who arrived in the Vatican from Marseille, France, awaiting the election of the new pope, agreed.
“Everybody has their role and we are happy to stay at our place, which is not within the hierarchy of the Church,” she said, asking her surname to be withheld. “It [women as deacons or priests] would denaturalise the institution of the Church and the process of transmitting the faith,” she said.
There is also the conservative guard that was outraged by Francis’s decision to appoint nonclerical people to top positions. In an interview with the Italian newspaper Repubblica last week, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller from Germany, a leading conservative, noted how the Roman Curia – the administrative body of the Roman Catholic Church – is an ecclesiastical body that should not be managed by lay people, likely a criticism of Sister Brambilla’s appointment last year.
Still, the Church cannot afford to ignore the subject of women and their role any more, suggested Sabina Pavone, a professor of history of Christianity at the University of Naples L’Orientale and member of the Italian Society of Historians.
“There is an awareness that this topic needs to be addressed because it continues to be considered one of the hot topics, but how to address it – that is not clear yet,” Pavone said.
The issue of women’s inclusion in the Church is increasingly also a practical matter central to the very functioning of Catholic institutions, she pointed out. Women already run the show in many areas of the world, from managing parishes, supporting local healthcare systems and teaching, while fewer men are entering the priesthood in most places.
“The Church has already changed,” Pavone said. “And the Church has to keep pace with this reality.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/6/women-in-the-catholic-church-which-way-will-the-next-pope-go

Latin America,Politics,Brazil police arrest two suspects over Lady Gaga gig bomb plot,"Brazilian police have arrested two people in connection with an alleged plot to detonate explosives at a Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro that drew more than two million people.
The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro said on social media on Sunday that it had thwarted a bomb attack that had been planned by the suspects for the free concert, held on the famous Copacabana Beach on Saturday.
The police added that an adult “responsible for the plan” had been arrested along with a teenager in an operation codenamed “Fake Monster” – a reference to “Little Monsters”, the star’s pet name for her fans.
The suspects, it said, had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in the aim of “gaining notoriety on social media”. Police working in coordination with the Justice Ministry carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso.
Felipe Cury, secretary of the Rio Police, said on Sunday that authorities believed the suspects sought to target Brazil’s LGBTQ community as they had “clearly” stated they were planning an attack “motivated by sexual orientation”.
Rio Police Chief Luiz Lima said the group behind the plot disseminated hate speech and violent content online “in order to attract more viewers, more participants – most of them teenagers, many of them children”.
The show, which Rio City Hall said attracted 2.1 million people, went ahead without disruption even though Brazilian authorities said they had arrested suspects in the hours preceding the event.
A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said in a statement that the star and her team had not been aware of safety concerns “prior to and during the show”, only learning about the threat the next morning.
The statement added: “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”
Security was tight at Saturday’s concert, with 5,200 military and police officers deployed to the beach where fans revelled in the pop singer’s classic hits like the song Born This Way, which became an LGBTQ anthem after its 2011 release.
The free beach concert stood out at a time of exorbitant ticket prices for live music around the world.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/4/brazil-police-arrest-two-suspects-over-lady-gaga-gig-bomb-plot
Latin America,Politics,Brazil’s ex-President Bolsonaro discharged after three weeks in hospital,"Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro has been discharged after spending three weeks in hospital recovering from major abdominal surgery.
The right-wing politician, who led the South American country between 2019 and 2022 before losing his re-election bid, was being treated for an intestinal obstruction before his release on Sunday.
He has had several medical complications, including six surgeries, since a 2018 stabbing that left him with lasting injuries.
The 70-year-old Bolsonaro had earlier on Sunday said on social media that he was set to be discharged, and even suggested that he would try to attend a rally on Wednesday being planned by supporters.
“I’m going home renewed. My next challenge: joining the Peaceful March for Humanitarian Amnesty on Wednesday, May 7,” Bolsonaro wrote.
The rally is being held in support of an amnesty for supporters of the former president who stormed government buildings following Bolsonaro’s loss to current Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2022. Bolsonaro had refused to publically acknowledge his defeat at the time.
Bolsonaro had been touring the country attempting to drum up support for an amnesty for the January 2023 riots when he was hospitalised after experiencing severe abdominal pain during a political event in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte in April.
The ex-president, who is aligned with right-wing figures in the United States and elsewhere, has his own legal troubles, after Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled in March that he should stand trial for being part of an alleged plot to overturn his 2022 election loss.
Thirty-three others have been accused of being part of the coup plot, which reportedly included a plan to poison President Lula and kill a Supreme Court judge.
Bolsonaro has already been barred by the Supreme Court from running in any elections until 2030 over his abuse of power while he was in office, and spreading rumours that the country’s electronic voting system was rife with fraud.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/4/brazils-ex-president-bolsonaro-discharged-after-three-weeks-in-hospital

Latin America,Uncategorized,Alvarez beats Scull to reclaim undisputed super-middleweight title,"Saul “Canelo” Alvarez has re-unified the IBF super middleweight championship with his WBA (Super), WBC and WBO belts with a unanimous decision victory over William Scull, setting up a bout with former welterweight champion Terence Crawford in September.
Cuba’s Scull, who had an advantage in height and reach over Alvarez, was unable to find an answer to the Mexican’s methodical stalking and effective body blows as he suffered the first loss of his professional boxing career on Sunday.
“For me, it’s a boring fight. [Scull was] not trying to win, just trying to survive. I hate these kinds of fights,” Alvarez said in his post-fight interview after all three judges awarded him the victory (115-113, 116-112, 119-109).
Alvarez, who was stripped of the IBF strap last year after choosing to fight Edgar Berlanga over the sanctioning body’s number-one contender Scull, has now become the undisputed 168-pound champion for the second time.
Scull’s quick movements were not enough to evade Alvarez’s steady onslaught early on as the Mexican landed strong body blows in the second and fourth rounds, leaving Scull momentarily off balance.
Alvarez, fighting outside the United States and Mexico for the first time, continued stalking the Cuban in the fifth round, but Scull fought back, breaking Alvarez’s guard with a right uppercut and pushing him back before catching him with a counter.
“Don’t let this guy get bigger and more confident,” Alvarez’s corner warned him at the end of the sixth round after Scull caught him with another right hand before Alvarez responded with body shots.
Alvarez landed combinations to the body in the seventh round, and caught Scull with a lead left hook near the ropes in the eighth.
Measured attacks to the body continued from Alvarez, as he landed 40 body blows in the bout while Scull managed only six, claiming the 63rd win of his professional career.
Alvarez, 34, improved to 63-2-2 with 39 knockouts after doing enough on his Saudi debut which continued his tradition of fighting during the Mexican festival weekend of Cinco de Mayo.
The Mexican said he was looking forward to returning to the ring against undefeated Crawford in Las Vegas.
“Crawford is one of the best out there, I like to share the ring with that kind of a fighter. It’s my pleasure,” he said.
American Crawford, who became the undisputed welterweight champion with a knockout win over Errol Spence Jr in 2023, said he was ready to take on Alvarez as they faced off in the ring.
“In September, I’ll show the world what greatness looks like,” Crawford said.
Alvarez signed a four-fight deal with Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh Seasons promotion in February.
In recent years, the kingdom has been pouring money into boxing events as part of Saudi Arabia’s oil-funded thrust into the sporting world, which has drawn accusations of “sportswashing” its dire human rights record.
Along with Formula One, the LIV Golf tour and attracting several ageing football stars to its domestic league, Saudi Arabia was named last year as the host of the 2034 football World Cup.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/4/canelo-alvarez-beats-scull-to-reclaim-undisputed-super-middleweight-title
Latin America,Politics,Sheinbaum says she rejected Trump’s offer to send US troops to Mexico,"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says she rejected an offer from her United States counterpart, Donald Trump, to send US troops to Mexico to help combat drug trafficking.
Speaking at a public event on Saturday, Sheinbaum said Trump had asked her during a call how he could help fight organised crime and suggested sending US troops.
The Mexican leader said she declined, telling Trump, “We will never accept the presence of the United States army in our territory.”
Sheinbaum added: “I told him, ‘No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable, our sovereignty is not for sale.'”
Her comments come a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was pressuring Mexico to allow “deeper US military involvement” in the fight against drug cartels.
Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the news outlet said “tension rose” during an April 16 call between the two leaders as Trump “pushed to have US armed forces take a leading role in battling Mexican drug gangs that produce and smuggle fentanyl to the US”.
Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly hit out at Mexico and the US’s other neighbour, Canada, over drug trafficking.
He has accused the two countries of allowing illegal drugs, most notably fentanyl, to flow over their borders into the US.
Trump’s administration has also tied its push to impose steep tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods to fentanyl trafficking, among other factors.
On Saturday, Sheinbaum said she had offered to collaborate with the US during her talks with Trump, including through greater information-sharing.
At the same time, the Mexican president said she had urged Trump to stop the cross-border arms trafficking that has contributed to a wave of violence that has killed more than 450,000 in Mexico over nearly two decades.
She added that Trump issued an order on Friday “to ensure that everything necessary is in place to prevent weapons from entering our country from the United States”.
A spokesperson for the US National Security Council told the Reuters news agency that Trump had been “crystal clear that Mexico must do more to combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries”.
The spokesperson added that Trump had worked closely with Sheinbaum to achieve the “most secure southwest border in history”.
But “dangerous foreign terrorist organizations continue to threaten our shared security and the drugs and crime they spread threaten American communities across the country”, the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, Trump has continued to push forward with his plan to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in US history, despite several legal challenges against his hardline anti-immigration policies.
The US Department of Defense said earlier this week that it designated a second stretch on the border with Mexico as a military zone to enforce immigration laws.
The newest area is in the US state of Texas and is attached to the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso.
Like the first zone established last month in New Mexico, military personnel are authorised to take custody of migrants who irregularly cross the border until they are transferred to civilian authorities in the US Department of Homeland Security.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/3/sheinbaum-says-she-rejected-trumps-offer-to-send-us-troops-to-mexico
Latin America,Uncategorized,"Why is measles spreading in Canada, Mexico and the US?","The United States and Canada are experiencing one of their worst measles outbreaks in years, while the virus has also crossed to neighbouring Mexico.
A total of 2,500 cases and four deaths have been reported in the outbreaks across the three countries. Vaccine hesitancy has been blamed.
Here is what we know about the outbreaks so far and why measles cases are on the rise.
Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that starts with symptoms including high fever, cough, runny nose, red or watery eyes, and sensitivity to light. A few days after infection, a red, blotchy rash typically appears on the face and spreads down the body. Fatigue and loss of appetite are also common.
Most people recover within two to three weeks but complications, particularly in young children and those with weakened immune systems, can be serious.
These include ear infections, diarrhoea, pneumonia and brain swelling (encephalitis) which can lead to permanent disability or death. In wealthier countries, measles causes about one death in every 5,000 cases, but in lower-income regions with weaker healthcare systems, the fatality rate can be as high as one in 100.
Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, about 3 to 4 million cases of measles were reported annually in the US, with hundreds of deaths and thousands of hospitalisations. By 2000, following widespread vaccination, measles was declared “eliminated” in the US – meaning there had been no continuous transmission of the disease for more than 12 months. Countries that have eliminated a disease through vaccines are considered to have “herd immunity” as long as vaccines continue to be offered to everyone.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a community become immune to a disease, either through vaccination or by recovering from an infection.
The number of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity for the whole community varies from disease to disease. Measles, which spreads very easily, requires 95 percent of a community to have immunity.
When most people are immune, the disease has a much harder time spreading – meaning it is more likely to die before it can be transmitted to another host. This helps to protect those who cannot be vaccinated for specific reasons, including newborn babies or people with certain health conditions.
Experts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination due to the potentially severe effects of a measles infection.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.
The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.
The vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like the United Kingdom.
Breakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.
North America is experiencing a significant measles resurgence, with more than 2,500 confirmed cases across the US, Canada and Mexico. Three deaths have occurred in the US and one in Mexico. The outbreak began in late 2024 in Ontario, Canada, before spreading to Texas and northern Mexico in early 2025, with Mennonite communities (Anabaptist Christian congregations), a historically under-vaccinated population, being the hardest hit.
A WHO report in April stated that measles cases in the Americas during the first three months of this year were 11 times higher than during the same period in 2024. The region now faces a “high” risk of measles outbreaks, compared with a “moderate” risk globally, the WHO said.
The US has so far reported 935 confirmed measles cases across 30 states, with Texas being the epicentre of the outbreak, accounting for 683 of those cases. The outbreak has now also spread to New Mexico (67 cases), Oklahoma (16) and Kansas (37).
Three people died from measles between February and April, including two unvaccinated children in Texas and one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico. These mark the country’s first measles deaths since 2015.
In 2019, the US experienced its most significant measles outbreak since 1992, with 1,274 confirmed cases reported across 31 states, but no deaths.
Meanwhile, Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in more than 25 years. Since mid-October 2024, Ontario alone has recorded more than 1,000 cases.
Canadian officials confirmed that the outbreak had originated from a large gathering in New Brunswick province that involved Mennonite communities, which strive for a simple life and tend to avoid modern technology and medicine.
In Mexico, the number of measles cases has risen sharply this year in the northern state of Chihuahua, where 786 cases have been reported so far. Just seven cases were reported in the whole country last year. A 31-year-old, unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April.
According to the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the main reason measles is spreading is that fewer people are taking up vaccines. Misinformation and growing hesitancy have seen vaccination rates dropping below the level needed for herd immunity.
In some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.
The US CDC reported that during the 2023-2024 school year, exemptions from one or more vaccines were claimed by parents or carers of 3.3 percent of preschool children, compared with 3 percent the previous year. Exemptions were higher in 40 states and the District of Columbia, with 14 states reporting exemption rates exceeding 5 percent.
Health officials point to how closely connected the affected communities in the US, Canada and Mexico are, with people frequently travelling between them. Mennonite groups, in particular, have strong cross-border ties and lower vaccination rates, making it much easier for the virus to spread from one region to another.
Anti-vaccine advocates, often referred to as “anti-vaxxers”, oppose vaccinations for a number of reasons, including fears about side effects, distrust of pharmaceutical companies or government agencies, and religious or personal beliefs.
Mennonite groups in Ontario and Chihuahua have also historically been hesitant about taking up vaccines, and health authorities say a significant share of recent measles cases in these areas are concentrated within this population.
One of the most persistent myths driving vaccine hesitancy is the claim that vaccines cause autism. This belief stems from a 1998 study that has since been discredited and retracted.
Robert F Kennedy Jr’s appointment as US Secretary of Health and Human Services prompted concern among health experts, particularly as measles cases are on the rise across North America.
Kennedy, a longstanding vaccine sceptic, has repeated false claims that vaccines are linked to autism and that the MMR vaccine contains “aborted fetus debris”.
Health experts have debunked this claim. The rubella part of the vaccine was made using lab-grown cells which were copied from a single foetal sample taken in the 1960s. These cells have been multiplied in labs for decades and are used to grow the virus needed for the vaccine. But the cells themselves are removed during the process, so there is no fetal tissue in the actual shot.
Kennedy has been criticised for downplaying the severity of the current measles outbreak, and for promoting unproven treatments for measles. He has suggested alternatives including vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which experts say do not replace vaccination and are not backed by strong scientific evidence.
Kennedy has also made major changes to the Department of Health and Human Services, firing thousands of employees and cutting budgets for key agencies like the CDC, which experts say could weaken the country’s ability to respond to health emergencies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/3/why-is-measles-spreading-in-canada-mexico-and-the-us
Europe,Uncategorized,"Factcheck: Was cocaine on the table in Macron video with Starmer, Merz?","Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones seized on a May 9 video of a train car meeting among three European leaders to claim they had used drugs and were trying to hide it.
The video showed French President Emmanuel Macron sitting at a table with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer. On the table before them were two blue folders, two drinking glasses and a small white object. The three men smiled for photographers who had gathered. Just as the shutter clicks started, Macron removed the crumpled white object from the tabletop and held it in his fist.
“DEVELOPING SCANDAL: Macron, Starmer, and Merz caught on video on their return from Kiev. A bag of white powder on the table. Macron quickly pockets it, Merz hides the spoon,” Jones said in a May 11 X post. “No explanation given. (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky, known cocaine enthusiast, had just hosted them. All three of the ‘leaders’ look completely cracked out.”
Jones’s post had been viewed more than 29.5 million times as of May 13 and he promoted the drug-use narrative in several more posts. “BREAKING: It’s Coke,” he said in another May 11 post later that day. A few hours later, he shared another photo that he said “clearly” showed “a bag of Blow”. Similar posts spread in Spanish.
Jones did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. But original videos of the meeting by the AFP news agency and The Associated Press and high-resolution photos captured by AP showed the white object Macron removed from the table was not a bag of white powder – it was a tissue.
Elysee, the official X account of the French presidency and the Elysse Palace presidential residence, posted pictures that also showed what appeared to be a tissue on the table. It said on X that the white object was a tissue “for blowing your nose”, adding that “this fake news is being spread by France’s enemies, both abroad and at home. We must remain vigilant against manipulation.”
In an email to PolitiFact, a German government spokesperson described Jones’s allegation as “absurd”.
Jones’s post also got another detail wrong. He said Zelenskyy “had just hosted” Macron, Starmer and Merz. However, the news reports said the leaders were on their way to meet Zelenskyy when the photos and videos were captured; they had not already met with him.
We asked digital forensic experts to analyse the close-up photo Jones posted that he alleged “clearly” showed a bag. Experts said they were unconvinced it was authentic.
V.S. Subrahmanian, a Northwestern University computer science professor, and Hany Farid, a University of California digital forensic expert, told PolitiFact that the image could have been modified using artificial intelligence, producing an image that may make the object look less like a tissue.
Darren Linvill, a Clemson University communication professor who studies Russian disinformation campaigns, said he saw the earliest mentions of this narrative in French on May 10.
At about 7:34 ET on May 11, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted images of the meeting on the messaging app Telegram; she’d added red circles around the white object on the table. Her caption said Macron, Starmer and Merz had forgotten “to put away their paraphernalia” before journalists arrived to take photos, according to a Guardian report and a Google Translate translation of her post from Russian to English. Her post also described Zelenskyy as an “unbalanced drug addict” who used cocaine in 2022.
Linvill said the false narrative proliferated across English social media – including X, Facebook and Reddit – on the morning of May 11. It was amplified and popularised by “accounts known to be part of the Russian Storm-1516 campaign distribution network”, he said.
Russian disinformation experts told PolitiFact it’s not uncommon for Russian influence campaigns to falsely accuse foreign leaders of illicit drug use, specifically involving cocaine.
“Anything that makes the leaders of rival nations appear debauched and corrupt works to their advantage,” Linvill said. “Russia wants to undercut the legitimacy of Western democracy to make their own system appear better by comparison.”
Scott Radnitz, a University of Washington professor at the Jackson School of International Studies, said the cocaine claim tapped into “a long-running Kremlin narrative” that Zelenskyy uses drugs.
A senior Russian official in 2024 called Zelenskyy an “illegitimate drug addict” and accused him of trying to continue the Ukrainian war to preserve his power.
In 2022, PolitiFact also fact-checked a deceptively edited video that said it showed Zelenskyy saying he does cocaine. In the original video, Zelenskyy said he likes coffee and denied he uses cocaine. Such rumours date back to the 2019 Ukrainian presidential campaign, when Zelenskyy’s political rival challenged him to a drug test, which Zelenskyy took without any narcotics being detected. We found no credible news reports supporting claims that Zelenskyy uses drugs.
Radnitz said far-right online influencers like Jones often disseminate pro-Kremlin conspiracy theories. Some reports have said Jones’s website Infowars has republished more than 1,000 articles from a Russian state-sponsored outlet.
“In this instance, the cocaine connection was broadened to also include world leaders in order to discredit an otherwise successful diplomatic engagement for Ukraine,” Radnitz said.

Europe,Uncategorized,"In some Jewish families, speaking up for Palestine stirs discontent","On a cold December day during the Christmas holidays, Dalia Sarig’s 80-year-old father arrived at her home in Vienna after she had returned from a skiing trip.
He was there to pick up her stepsister, who had joined Sarig’s family on vacation.
She was convinced it would be her last meeting with her father, as their political differences were about to come to a head.
“I said goodbye. I hugged him,” she told Al Jazeera. “When I said goodbye, I said goodbye knowing that maybe I will not see him any more.”
Tensions with her Jewish family had been building for years. At 56, Sarig, a pro-Palestine activist, is at odds with most of her relatives.
Her parents adhere to Zionism, the nationalist political ideology that called for the creation of a Jewish state and is seen by Palestinians and their supporters as the system that underpins their suffering.
Sarig knew during that December meeting with her father that she intended to stage a pro-Palestine demonstration outside parliament in January that would be filmed by a local television station. The activist group she was a part of had put her forward for a broadcast interview. Appalled by Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and determined to speak up, she went ahead with it.
“The interview was broadcast and it immediately went to my family.”
She later heard that her father, who also lives in the Austrian capital, had told friends that “to him, I died”.
“But he never talked about it with me, he never reached out to me to tell me something like this. [He] just cut the relation.”
Her 77-year-old mother, who lives in Germany, messaged her a week later.
“I still have it here in my phone, saying, you know, ‘I will not accept your political activism. You’re a traitor, you are dirtying the nest … and should you change your political views, we can return to normal. Stay healthy.’”
She has not spoken with her parents since.
Family divides are not uncommon among Jewish families from the United States to Israel, but have become more entrenched since October 7, 2023.
On that day, Hamas, the group that governs the Gaza Strip, led an incursion into southern Israel during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive. Since then, Israeli bombardments have killed more than 61,700 people in the enclave.
“I think one of the most interesting phenomena among the liberal Zionists is the fact, while the majority moved to the right because of October 7, a minority became even more disenchanted with Israel and Zionism,” the author and academic Ilan Pappe, a prominent critic of Zionism, told Al Jazeera.
Sarig’s ancestors fled Austria in 1938, the year of annexation by Nazi Germany, for Serbia. They later settled in Palestine under the British Mandate in what is now present-day Israel. But by the 1950s, most of her relatives had returned to Austria, where she was born.
As a child, she celebrated Jewish holidays while learning about Zionism from elders.
She was also told that Palestinians “are the enemies, they want to kill all the Jews … that the Jews living there [in Israel] wanted peace, but the Arabs did not”.
At 18, she moved to Israel, where, at her parents’ encouragement, she joined a leftist Zionist youth movement.
Over 13 years in Israel, she joined a kibbutz, served in the Israeli army in an office role, and married. But it was as she studied politics and Middle East history at Haifa University that her worldview began to change.
That’s where she met a Palestinian professor and later became an activist for Palestinian rights.
“It began on a lawn in an evening together with my Palestinian teacher, when he told me the story of his family that was displaced from a small village.
“I understood that what I have been told, the Zionist narrative, is wrong,” she said. “I started to think how he might feel, how he’s feeling, or how I might feel as a Palestinian living in a Jewish state where my ancestors were expelled.”
Back in Austria, her family would argue with her at gatherings, agree never to speak again on Palestine and Israeli politics, break their promises, and clash once again.
In 2015, she renounced her Israeli citizenship as a gesture against Zionism.
“It makes my activism easier,” Sarig said, on being disowned by some of her family. “I lost my Jewish community because I was considered at best, strange and weird, and at worst, a traitor.”
But being cut off from one’s family can take a toll on mental health, say experts.
According to Faissal Sharif, a neuroscientist and doctoral student at the University of Oxford, brain imaging studies have shown that “the experience of social isolation triggers activity in areas that would otherwise light up in response to physical pain”.
“In other words, social pain is not metaphorical – it is biologically real,” he told Al Jazeera.
Families, he said, often form “microcultures” with their own rules and positions on political issues.
“The betrayal felt when love and acceptance are made conditional upon silence or complicity in the genocide can be deeply wounding. In the context of Gaza, it adds an additional layer of trauma: not only is one bearing witness to mass suffering, but also paying a personal price for refusing to look away,” he said. “This leads to long-lasting stress and anxiety, which can reach clinical levels.”
To preserve relationships, he said families need to lead with “curiosity, not confrontation”.
“Especially when the topic is something as painful as war or genocide, facts alone won’t move people – naming the emotions underneath, like fear, guilt, or grief, often opens more space for real dialogue.”
Having such conversations isn’t easy.
Jonathan Ofir, a musician who was born in an Israeli kibbutz and emigrated to Denmark in the late 1990s, said that it was in 2009 that he realised he had “actually been indoctrinated into a propaganda that omitted a whole Palestinian viewpoint”. He read Pappe’s book, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, describing that experience as a “turning point” for him.
Around the same time, he read other Jewish and Palestinian writers who “challenged the Zionist narrative”.
“[But] I didn’t share this publicly and I didn’t share it with my family either.”
In 2014, though, during Israel’s war on Gaza – the third within seven years – he said he felt confident enough to express his critical views “outwards and publicly”.
More than 2,000 Palestinians – including 551 children – were killed during the 50-day conflict.
He took to Facebook to post an image of Israelis gathered on a hilltop near Sderot watching on as Gaza burned, a photograph that was featured in The New York Times.
A relative soon wrote him an email that concluded by recommending that Ofir “stop posting on the internet”.
“It became this heated debate, but it very, very quickly stopped.”
Years later, he learned that his family in Israel had decided to avoid talking about politics around him “so as to not legitimise my political views”, he said.
After the October 7 attack, he checked on his extended family who lived near the site of the assault. But the incursion did not alter his position.
“My outlook hasn’t significantly changed. But something changed in the Israeli society. And in that sense, you could say we might be more distant politically.”
Netherlands-based Daniel Friedman, 44, was raised in South Africa by his father, Steven, an academic and vocal critic of Zionism, and his mother, who was part of a circle of anti-Apartheid activists.
While his father remains an anti-Zionist, Friedman said that he and his mother have increasingly been clashing over Israel’s genocide in Gaza since late 2023.
“This is really the only issue nowadays” affecting the conversations and bonds within some Jewish communities, he said.
One of their earlier arguments regarded the debunked claims that Palestinian fighters raped women during the October 7 incursion. After several uneasy disputes, often battled out by ping-ponging various newspaper links to support their arguments on WhatsApp, they have agreed to stop talking about politics.
“I love her, but what I struggle with is that I’ve lost a lot of trust for her,” said Friedman.
During a previous Israeli war on Gaza, his mother had signed a petition calling for a ceasefire, a move which saw her rejected by some family members. “I think that had quite a big effect,” he said. “She kind of went to the right.”
He said that he understands that for some, taking a stand means risking losing the support of a close community. He, however, chose to “cut a lot of people out of my life on purpose” after October 7, he said.
Back in Vienna, Sarig is busy organising a conference of Jewish anti-Zionists in June, featuring speakers such as Stephen Kapos, a UK-based Holocaust survivor, the American podcaster and commentator Katie Halper and Ronnie Barkan, a Jewish Israeli activist. Pappe too is expected to attend.
As the killings in Gaza continue, her focus, she said, is on the Palestinians trying to survive Israeli fire.
“I’m not the victim,” Sarig said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/14/in-some-jewish-families-speaking-up-for-palestine-causes-discontent
Europe,Uncategorized,Peter Sullivan weeps as UK court overturns murder conviction after 38 years,"A man who spent nearly four decades in a British prison for the killing of a barmaid said he was not angry or bitter as his murder conviction was overturned and he was released after being exonerated by DNA evidence.
Peter Sullivan, 68, was freed after the court in London determined on Tuesday that new evidence found on the victim’s body showed that he “was not the defendant” of the murder.
“This is an unprecedented and historic moment. Our client Peter Sullivan is the longest-serving victim of a miscarriage of justice in the UK,” his lawyer told reporters outside the court on Tuesday following the decision issued by an appeals court.
Sullivan, who wept as the judges dismissed his conviction, said, in a statement read outside the court by his lawyer, that despite spending years in jail he was “not angry” or “bitter”.
“I lost my liberty four decades ago over a crime I did not commit,” he said.
Sullivan was arrested in 1986, a month after Diane Sindall, 21, was found dead in Bebington, near Liverpool in northwest England.
Sindall had been on the way home from work when she was attacked, sexually assaulted and beaten to death in a killing which shocked the area.
Sullivan was just 30 when he was convicted in 1987, and his two past attempts to appeal against his sentence failed.
In 2021, he applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission – an independent body that investigates potential miscarriages of justice, raising concerns about his police interviews, bite-mark evidence presented in his trial, and what was said to be the murder weapon, the commission said in a statement.
The commission then obtained DNA information from samples taken at the time of the offence and found that the profile did not match that of Sullivan. His case was then sent to London’s Court of Appeal.
Lawyers for the Crown Prosecution Service, which brought the case against Sullivan, said the new evidence meant there was “no credible basis on which the appeal can be opposed”.
It was “sufficient fundamentally to cast doubt on the safety of the conviction”, they added.
Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said police were now appealing for more information in a renewed bid to solve Sindall’s murder.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/peter-sullivan-weeps-as-uk-court-overturns-murder-conviction-after-38-years
Europe,Politics,Kremlin declines to say if Putin will meet Ukraine’s Zelenskyy in Istanbul,"The Kremlin has again declined to say whether President Vladimir Putin will travel to Turkiye for planned negotiations with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, amid growing international pressure on Moscow to hold direct talks and end its three-year war.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that Moscow would disclose the makeup of its delegation to Turkiye once Putin gave the order.
“The Russian delegation will be waiting for the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul on May 15,” he said.
Peskov said he would provide an update “when we get the relevant instructions from the president”.
“No such instructions have been received yet.”
The planned negotiations, expected to take place on Thursday in Istanbul, Turkiye’s commercial hub, would be the first direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow since 2022, shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour.
Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Turkiye where he said he would hold talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on either Wednesday or Thursday.
The Ukrainian leader has challenged Putin to meet him in Turkiye, saying if he does not show up, it would show that Moscow is not interested in peace.
He also urged United States President Donald Trump, currently on a tour of Middle Eastern countries, to visit Turkiye and participate in the talks.
Trump on Wednesday said there was a “possibility” he would head to Turkiye for talks on Ukraine if Putin also travelled there.
“I don’t know that he (Putin) would be there if I’m not there,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he flew from Saudi Arabia to Qatar.
“I know he would like me to be there, and that’s a possibility. If we could end the war, I’d be thinking about that,” he said.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is already set to travel to Istanbul on Friday.
“Marco is going and Marco has been very effective,” Trump said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged to press Putin to attend negotiations with Zelenskyy in Turkiye.
Lula is expected to stop in the Russian capital on the way back from attending a regional forum in China.
“I’ll try to talk to Putin,” Lula said at a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday before his departure.
“It costs me nothing to say, ‘hey, comrade Putin, go to Istanbul and negotiate, dammit,'” he said.
Lula’s comments come after the Ukrainian foreign minister urged Brazil to use its influence with Russia to secure a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy.
Brazil and China issued a joint statement on Tuesday calling for direct negotiations as the “only way to end the conflict”.
Peskov also condemned comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron that Paris was open to deploying nuclear-armed warplanes in other European countries.
On Tuesday, Macron told France’s TF1 television that nuclear arms proliferation would not enhance the continent’s security.
“The Americans have the bombs on planes in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Turkiye,” he said, adding, “We are ready to open this discussion. I will define the framework in a very specific way in the weeks and months to come.”

Europe,Uncategorized,US reality TV star Kim Kardashian testifies about Paris robbery,"Reality TV star and business mogul Kim Kardashian has testified before a French courtroom about her experience getting robbed at gunpoint in a Paris hotel.
Taking the witness stand on Tuesday, Kardashian confronted the suspects accused of tying her up and taping her mouth shut on October 3, 2016, while they stole more than $6m in jewellery.
The case concerns a group of about a dozen suspects known in French media as “les papys braqueurs”: the grandpa robbers. The group, many in their 60s and 70s, are part of a crime ring, according to prosecutors. One has died since the robbery took place, while the charges against another have been dismissed due to health concerns.
But Kardashian recounted the terror she felt as members of the group burst into her hotel room after a night at the Paris Fashion Week.
“We were leaving the next morning, so I was just packing up,” Kardashian said. “It was around three in the morning. I heard stomping up the stairs when I was in bed.”
She explained that she figured it was her older sister, Kourtney Kardashian, returning to the hotel room. But instead, it was a group of armed men, dressed as police officers and wearing balaclavas.
Waving a gun at her, one of the men asked her to surrender her $4m engagement ring, a gift from her then-husband Kanye West, a rapper now known as Ye.
“Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say ‘Ring! Ring!’ in English, with an accent, pointing,” she said.
At one point, she said the robbers threw her onto the hotel bed. She was wearing a bathrobe at the time.
“I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,” Kardashian explained. “I absolutely did think I was going to die.”
Her mind flashed to the idea of her sister coming home to find her body, she added. “I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever.”
But the robbers proceeded to restrain her with zip ties and duct tape. They told her she would be safe so long as she remained quiet.
“I have babies,” Kardashian, a mother of four, remembered thinking. “I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.”
Eventually, she was locked in the hotel room’s marble bathroom while the robbers made their escape. During her testimony, she explained that the suspects did not beat her during the attack.
“I was grabbed and dragged into the other room and thrown onto the floor, but wasn’t hit, no,” she said.
Eventually, Kardashian said she was able to use the bathroom sink to loosen the restraints on her hands. She hobbled downstairs, where she met with her stylist Simone Harouche, who had locked herself in a bathroom one floor below to call for help during the attack.
“She was beside herself. I’ve never seen her like that before,” Harouche said of Kardashian. “She just was screaming and kept saying, ‘We need to get out of here. We need help. What are we going to do if they come back?'”
The attack prompted the entertainment industry to adopt new procedures around security and social media posts, including through the delayed publication of certain images that might help robbers identify targets and locations.
Some critics, however, blamed Kardashian herself for her luxurious lifestyle and lack of on-hand security. The controversial fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, for instance, was quoted by the Reuters news agency as questioning Kardashian’s habit of posting photos of herself on social media.
“You cannot display your wealth and then be surprised that some people want to share it with you,” the late designer said.
That kind of commentary has sparked its own backlash, with some denouncing it as victim-blaming. Still, Judge David De Pas in Paris asked those involved if they had not made themselves targets.
“Just because a woman wears jewellery, that doesn’t make her a target,” Harouche said. “That’s like saying that because a woman wears a short skirt that she deserves to be raped.”
Kardashian added that she had a bodyguard in a separate hotel. “We assumed that, if we were in a hotel, it was safe, it was secure,” she said.
She added that she now keeps five or six guards around her. She also blamed the Paris attack for prompting a copycat robbery at her Los Angeles house.
“I started to get this phobia of going out,” Kardashian said. “This experience really changed everything for us.”
Tuesday’s appearance is expected to be the only time Kardashian testifies in the criminal case, which includes 10 defendants: nine men and one woman.
Five of the men face armed robbery and kidnapping charges that could result in life imprisonment. Others face lesser charges of being accomplices or possessing unauthorised firearms.
Prosecutors say the ringleader in the group was a 69-year-old man named Aomar Ait Khedache, nicknamed “Omar the Old”. He wrote a letter of apology that was read aloud in the court.
“I do appreciate the letter, for sure. I forgive you,” Kardashian replied, looking at Khedache. “But it doesn’t change the feelings and the trauma and the fact that my life was forever changed, but I do appreciate the letter, thank you.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/us-reality-tv-star-kim-kardashian-testifies-about-paris-robbery

Europe,Politics,Albania’s ruling Socialists secure majority in parliamentary vote,"Albania’s ruling Socialist Party has won the country’s parliamentary elections, according to a near-complete vote count, securing Prime Minister Edi Rama an unprecedented fourth term in office.
With about 96 percent of ballots counted, the official results on Tuesday showed the Socialist Party got 82 seats in the 140-seat parliament with 52 percent of the votes.
The opposition centre-right Democratic Party secured 51 seats with 34 percent of votes. Three other small parties will take the rest of the seats.
The threshold for entry into the assembly in Albania is one percent for parties and five percent for party alliances.
The full results are expected later on Tuesday. If confirmed, the results would be an increase from the last election, where Rama’s party won 49 percent of the vote, and would give him a majority to form a government.
The Central Election Commission, the electoral executive, has said that by law, the final results come out 48 hours after the vote ends.
The results may be delayed following a request of the opposition not to consider about 53,000 ballots mailed from the diaspora in neighbouring Greece, claiming they are manipulated.
For the first time, those in the diaspora could cast postal votes. About 195,000 mailed in their votes.
Eligible voters in Albania and abroad voted to elect 140 lawmakers for a four-year mandate in the Balkan nation. Because of mass emigration, the country of 2.4 million people has a total of nearly 3.7 million eligible voters.
Diaspora votes from Greece may move a number of seats in three or four areas in favour of the ruling party. The opposition claims they were manipulated by Socialist supporters. The postal company said it has confirmation signatures of all the voters in Greece.
Rama, who has been in power since 2013, focused his campaign on working to gain membership in the European Union by 2030. Sali Berisha, the candidate of the conservative Democratic Party, argued that Albania still is not ready for the bloc’s membership.
Some analysts were surprised by the strength of Rama’s success, expecting that a series of corruption scandals and the recent unrest in the country due to a crackdown on the opposition would affect his results.
A joint international observation mission noted that despite being competitive and professionally managed, the election process so far was marked by the ruling party’s misuse of public resources, a confrontational and polarising tone, the two main political parties using divisive language, non-transparent financing, and unbalanced media coverage of smaller parties.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/albania-election-results-2025
Europe,Uncategorized,‘Not over yet’: Real Madrid hoping to deny Barcelona title celebrations,"Who: Real Madrid vs Mallorca
What: Spanish La Liga – Match day 36
Where: Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain
When: Wednesday at 9.30pm (19:30 GMT)
Follow Al Jazeera Sport’s live text and photo commentary stream.
Fresh from their demoralising 4-3 defeat at Barcelona in El Clasico on Sunday, Real Madrid will now face Mallorca at home at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday as they desperately try to keep their La Liga title defence alive.
With three rounds to play, the championship calculus is relatively simple: Real need to keep winning and hope Barcelona, who have lost only two games in 2025 across all competitions, lose their remaining three league games.
Here are the key talking points as the Spanish giants embark on their must-win Match day 36 fixture against Mallorca, who currently sit ninth on the La Liga ladder:
Barcelona’s dramatic 4-3 come-from-behind victory against Real on Sunday was undoubtedly the most devastating defeat of the four El Clasico fixtures Madrid have conceded to their great rivals in the 2024-25 season.
On most days, star striker Kylian Mbappe’s two goals in the opening 14 minutes of El Clasico, followed by a hat-trick in the 70th minute, would have been enough to bury any team in the Spanish top-flight – but this Barcelona side is the exception.
Real Madrid now find themselves seven points behind the Catalan giants with just three rounds remaining in La Liga.
The basic maths is quite straightforward: if Real lose or draw with Mallorca on Wednesday, Barcelona – even if they lost their last three matches – would win the La Liga title on a countback; if Real beat Mallorca on Wednesday and Barcelona defeat Espanyol on Thursday, then Barcelona are instantly crowned champions.
Real Madrid began the season as the defending La Liga champions with lofty aspirations to complete a rare title treble: La Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League.
They did win the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Intercontinental Cup this season, but lost the Supercopa and Copa del Rey finals to Barcelona, while they were eliminated from the Champions League by Arsenal at the quarterfinal stage.
Real are 0-4 against Barcelona this season, having lost both La Liga fixtures as well as the aforementioned Supercopa and Copa del Rey finals.
It was announced on Monday that manager Carlo Ancelotti will leave Real Madrid for a second time, despite having a year remaining on his contract, after the Italian signed on to coach Brazil before the FIFA World Cup 2026.
Speculation of his departure had been in play for weeks after the 65-year-old all but admitted to the media he might leave the club after the Copa del Rey final loss to Barcelona on April 26.
Also on Monday, multiple Spanish media outlets reported that former Real Madrid star midfielder – and current Bayer Leverkusen manager – Xabi Alonso is set to become the club’s next boss on a three-year deal when he leaves the German club after this season.
Alonso, 43, is expected to join Real before the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup in the United States from June 15 to July 13, media reports said.
In a serious blow to Real Madrid’s short-term prospects, star forward Vinicius Junior will sit out the match against Mallorca after picking up an ankle injury, following Sunday’s 4-3 loss to Barcelona.
Further depleting the regular starting XI are Lucas Vazquez, who is struggling with a thigh injury, and Aurelien Tchouameni, who picked up a yellow-card suspension and will miss out on Wednesday’s crucial contest.
The mysterious status of key attacking midfielder Rodrygo, who occupied a seat on the bench during El Clasico and is rumoured to be refusing to play in recent matches, was addressed by Ancelotti on Tuesday, who explained to the media why the Brazilian star will miss his third straight fixture.
“Rodrygo was struck by a fever last week, which hindered his training and recovery. Today, he mentioned some thigh discomfort that requires our careful attention. Post-fever, he’s not yet in top form. Despite the swirling speculation, it’s clear that Rodrygo is cherished by everyone, especially me,” Ancelotti said.
David Alaba, Eder Militao, Antonio Rudiger and Dani Carvajal all remain unavailable through injury.
Manager Jagoba Arrasate is set to play Leo Roman in place of first-choice goalkeeper Dominik Greif against Real Madrid.
Key midfielder Robert Navarro is anticipated to miss the match as he battles back from an injury he picked up on March 2 against Alaves.
Abdon Prats, Chiquinho and Manu Morlanes are all questionable for this fixture.
Real Madrid: Courtois; Valverde, Vallejo, Asencio, F Garcia; Bellingham, Modric; Guler, B Diaz, Endrick; Mbappe
Mallorca: Roman; Maffeo, Valjent, Raillo, Mojica; Mascarell, Samu; Asano, D Rodriguez, Darder; Muriqi
“Every match against Mallorca is a battleground – intense and fiercely contested. Despite some key players being sidelined, we are prepared to field a formidable lineup. Our aim is to triumph in these final three games. The league battle is not over yet, and conceding to our adversaries is not an option. We’re determined to conclude this challenging season on a victorious note.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/13/real-madrid-vs-mallorca-la-liga-vinicius-jr-start-team-news-lineups
Europe,Uncategorized,French actor Gerard Depardieu found guilty of sexually assaulting two women,"A French court has handed down an 18-month suspended sentence to actor Gerard Depardieu after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021.
The Paris court announced on Tuesday morning that Depardieu, the 76-year-old who did not attend court for the verdict, would be placed on the sex offenders list.
In one of the country’s highest-profile Me Too cases, Depardieu, a prominent figure of French cinema who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
The trial relates to charges of sexual assault during the filming in 2021 of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) directed by Jean Becker.
One of the two plaintiffs, Amelie K, a 54-year-old set decorator, told the court that Depardieu had groped her as he trapped her between his legs and made explicit sexual comments.
“He touched everything, including my breasts,” she said, adding: “I was terrified, he was laughing.”
The second witness, a 34-year-old assistant director who was unnamed, said Depardieu initially assaulted her when she accompanied him from his dressing room to the set.
“It was nighttime … he put his hand on my buttocks,” she said, adding that the actor assaulted her on two other occasions.
Judge Thierry Donard said the actor’s explanation of the events had been unconvincing.
“I’m vulgar, rude, foul-mouthed, I’ll accept that,” Depardieu told the court, but added: “I don’t touch.”
“I adore women and femininity,” he also said, describing the Me Too movement as a “reign of terror”.
Depardieu also argued before the court that he did not consider placing a hand on a person’s bottom to be sexual assault and that some women were too easily shocked.
Amelie K’s lawyer described Tuesday’s ruling as a “beautiful decision” that gave recognition to Depardieu’s victims.
After the sentencing, Depardieu’s lawyer said they would appeal the court decision.
In recent years, the French actor has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations, with about 20 women coming forward with accusations, but this case was the first to go to court.
The Me Too movement came to prominence in 2017 for people to share their experiences of sexual abuse and sexual harassment by influential figures.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/french-actor-gerard-depardieu-found-guilty-of-sexually-assaulting-two-women
Europe,Sports,Djokovic exits coaching partnership with former tennis rival Murray,"Andy Murray will no longer be coaching former rival Novak Djokovic, ending their six-month partnership, the pair announced.
Djokovic stunned the tennis world in November when he said he had hired the retired Murray, who had no track record as a coach, to lead his off-court team.
But the two 37-year-old tennis greats have already parted company, with the former British player thanking Serbian star Djokovic for an “unbelievable opportunity”.
Their split comes after Djokovic, the winner of a record 24 men’s Grand Slam singles titles, endured a difficult start to the season, including losing his first match at his last two tournaments.
“Thanks to Novak for the unbelievable opportunity to work together and thanks to his team for all their hard work over the past six months,” Murray said in a statement released on Tuesday.
“I wish Novak all the best for the rest of the season,” added the Scot, who defeated Djokovic in the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon finals to win two of his three Grand Slam titles.
Their partnership started well, with Djokovic defeating Carlos Alcaraz at the Australian Open, only to retire through injury during his semifinal against Alexander Zverev.
But success has since proved elusive, with Djokovic saying on Tuesday: “Thank you, coach Andy, for all the hard work, fun and support over last six months on and off the court, really enjoyed deepening our friendship together.”
Murray, who retired after the 2024 Paris Olympics, is a three-time singles Grand Slam winner and former world number one.
The pair go their separate ways less than two weeks out from the 2025 French Open, which begins on May 25 at Roland Garros, Paris.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/13/djokovic-murray-coaching-partnership-ends-before-french-open
Europe,Uncategorized,"Zelenskyy will have face-to-face talks in Istanbul, but will Putin?","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will travel to Turkiye this week and wait to have face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid intensive pressure from the United States administration and European leaders to find a settlement to end the more than three-year-long war.
Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that he will be in Ankara on Thursday to conduct the negotiations. He will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the two will wait for Putin to arrive, he said. Zelenskyy and Erdogan would then both travel to Istanbul.
Putin has not yet said whether he will be at the talks he proposed. Moscow has not directly responded to Zelenskyy’s challenge for Putin to meet him in person at the negotiating table.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov again refused on Tuesday to tell reporters whether Putin will travel to Istanbul and who else might represent Russia at the potential talks. “As soon as the president considers it necessary, we will make an announcement,” Peskov said. Russia has only said it would send a delegation to Istanbul “without preconditions”.
If Zelenskyy and Putin were to meet on Thursday, it would be their first face-to-face meeting since December 2019. Much has changed since then.
United States President Donald Trump has urged the two sides to attend as part of Washington’s efforts to stop the fighting. Trump has offered to join the talks himself.
Trump said on Monday he was “thinking about actually flying over” to Istanbul to attend the negotiations. That was welcomed by Zelenskyy, but there was no reaction from Moscow.
“All of us in Ukraine would appreciate it if President Trump could be there with us at this meeting in Turkiye. This is the right idea. We can change a lot,” Zelenskyy said.
Trump publicly asked Zelenskyy to attend, after Putin on Sunday proposed the direct talks following a rejection of a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine and its Western allies insisted should come first.
The Ukrainian leader said he would, but that Putin should also attend in person. On Tuesday, his adviser Mykhailo Podolyak reiterated that Zelenskyy would only meet Putin and no other members of the Russian delegation.
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz pressed again for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire on Tuesday. “We are waiting for Putin’s agreement,” he said.
“We agree that, in case there is no real progress this week, we then want to push at European level for a significant tightening of sanctions … We will focus on further areas, such as the energy sector and the financial market,” Merz added.
He welcomed Zelenskyy’s readiness to travel to Istanbul, “but now it is really up to Putin to accept this offer of negotiations and agree to a ceasefire. The ball is in Russia’s court.”
French President Emmanuel Macron voiced support for fresh sanctions against Russia, warning they could be rolled out within days should Moscow fail to observe a ceasefire.
Speaking on Tuesday, Macron pointed to financial services and the energy sector—including oil and gas—as likely targets.
His comments follow a joint warning issued over the weekend by the UK, France, Germany and Poland, who said Russia would face tougher punitive measures unless it complied with demands for a 30-day ceasefire by Monday which Moscow has refused to do.
I have just heard President Trump's statement. Very important words.
I supported @POTUS idea of a full and unconditional ceasefire — long enough to provide the foundation for diplomacy. And we want it, we are ready to uphold silence on our end.
I supported President Trump…
— Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) May 12, 2025
Meanwhile, Ukraine said its air defence units destroyed all 10 drones that Russia launched overnight on Tuesday. This is the lowest number of drones that Russia has launched in an overnight attack in several weeks.
The Ukrainian military’s general staff said as of 10pm (19:00 GMT) on Monday, there had been 133 clashes with Russian forces along the front line since midnight, when the ceasefire proposed by European powers was to have come into effect.
Ukraine’s top commander, Oleksandr Syrskii, was quoted by Zelenskyy as saying the heaviest fighting still gripped the Donetsk region, the focus of the eastern front, and Russia’s western Kursk region, nine months after Kyiv’s forces staged a cross-border incursion.
Meanwhile, Russia accused Ukraine of attacking Belgorod, with Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov saying on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces used 65 drones and more than 100 rounds of ammunition to attack the region in the past day.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/trumps-offer-to-join-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-triggers-diplomacy

Middle East,Uncategorized,"In some Jewish families, speaking up for Palestine stirs discontent","On a cold December day during the Christmas holidays, Dalia Sarig’s 80-year-old father arrived at her home in Vienna after she had returned from a skiing trip.
He was there to pick up her stepsister, who had joined Sarig’s family on vacation.
She was convinced it would be her last meeting with her father, as their political differences were about to come to a head.
“I said goodbye. I hugged him,” she told Al Jazeera. “When I said goodbye, I said goodbye knowing that maybe I will not see him any more.”
Tensions with her Jewish family had been building for years. At 56, Sarig, a pro-Palestine activist, is at odds with most of her relatives.
Her parents adhere to Zionism, the nationalist political ideology that called for the creation of a Jewish state and is seen by Palestinians and their supporters as the system that underpins their suffering.
Sarig knew during that December meeting with her father that she intended to stage a pro-Palestine demonstration outside parliament in January that would be filmed by a local television station. The activist group she was a part of had put her forward for a broadcast interview. Appalled by Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and determined to speak up, she went ahead with it.
“The interview was broadcast and it immediately went to my family.”
She later heard that her father, who also lives in the Austrian capital, had told friends that “to him, I died”.
“But he never talked about it with me, he never reached out to me to tell me something like this. [He] just cut the relation.”
Her 77-year-old mother, who lives in Germany, messaged her a week later.
“I still have it here in my phone, saying, you know, ‘I will not accept your political activism. You’re a traitor, you are dirtying the nest … and should you change your political views, we can return to normal. Stay healthy.’”
She has not spoken with her parents since.
Family divides are not uncommon among Jewish families from the United States to Israel, but have become more entrenched since October 7, 2023.
On that day, Hamas, the group that governs the Gaza Strip, led an incursion into southern Israel during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive. Since then, Israeli bombardments have killed more than 61,700 people in the enclave.
“I think one of the most interesting phenomena among the liberal Zionists is the fact, while the majority moved to the right because of October 7, a minority became even more disenchanted with Israel and Zionism,” the author and academic Ilan Pappe, a prominent critic of Zionism, told Al Jazeera.
Sarig’s ancestors fled Austria in 1938, the year of annexation by Nazi Germany, for Serbia. They later settled in Palestine under the British Mandate in what is now present-day Israel. But by the 1950s, most of her relatives had returned to Austria, where she was born.
As a child, she celebrated Jewish holidays while learning about Zionism from elders.
She was also told that Palestinians “are the enemies, they want to kill all the Jews … that the Jews living there [in Israel] wanted peace, but the Arabs did not”.
At 18, she moved to Israel, where, at her parents’ encouragement, she joined a leftist Zionist youth movement.
Over 13 years in Israel, she joined a kibbutz, served in the Israeli army in an office role, and married. But it was as she studied politics and Middle East history at Haifa University that her worldview began to change.
That’s where she met a Palestinian professor and later became an activist for Palestinian rights.
“It began on a lawn in an evening together with my Palestinian teacher, when he told me the story of his family that was displaced from a small village.
“I understood that what I have been told, the Zionist narrative, is wrong,” she said. “I started to think how he might feel, how he’s feeling, or how I might feel as a Palestinian living in a Jewish state where my ancestors were expelled.”
Back in Austria, her family would argue with her at gatherings, agree never to speak again on Palestine and Israeli politics, break their promises, and clash once again.
In 2015, she renounced her Israeli citizenship as a gesture against Zionism.
“It makes my activism easier,” Sarig said, on being disowned by some of her family. “I lost my Jewish community because I was considered at best, strange and weird, and at worst, a traitor.”
But being cut off from one’s family can take a toll on mental health, say experts.
According to Faissal Sharif, a neuroscientist and doctoral student at the University of Oxford, brain imaging studies have shown that “the experience of social isolation triggers activity in areas that would otherwise light up in response to physical pain”.
“In other words, social pain is not metaphorical – it is biologically real,” he told Al Jazeera.
Families, he said, often form “microcultures” with their own rules and positions on political issues.
“The betrayal felt when love and acceptance are made conditional upon silence or complicity in the genocide can be deeply wounding. In the context of Gaza, it adds an additional layer of trauma: not only is one bearing witness to mass suffering, but also paying a personal price for refusing to look away,” he said. “This leads to long-lasting stress and anxiety, which can reach clinical levels.”
To preserve relationships, he said families need to lead with “curiosity, not confrontation”.
“Especially when the topic is something as painful as war or genocide, facts alone won’t move people – naming the emotions underneath, like fear, guilt, or grief, often opens more space for real dialogue.”
Having such conversations isn’t easy.
Jonathan Ofir, a musician who was born in an Israeli kibbutz and emigrated to Denmark in the late 1990s, said that it was in 2009 that he realised he had “actually been indoctrinated into a propaganda that omitted a whole Palestinian viewpoint”. He read Pappe’s book, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, describing that experience as a “turning point” for him.
Around the same time, he read other Jewish and Palestinian writers who “challenged the Zionist narrative”.
“[But] I didn’t share this publicly and I didn’t share it with my family either.”
In 2014, though, during Israel’s war on Gaza – the third within seven years – he said he felt confident enough to express his critical views “outwards and publicly”.
More than 2,000 Palestinians – including 551 children – were killed during the 50-day conflict.
He took to Facebook to post an image of Israelis gathered on a hilltop near Sderot watching on as Gaza burned, a photograph that was featured in The New York Times.
A relative soon wrote him an email that concluded by recommending that Ofir “stop posting on the internet”.
“It became this heated debate, but it very, very quickly stopped.”
Years later, he learned that his family in Israel had decided to avoid talking about politics around him “so as to not legitimise my political views”, he said.
After the October 7 attack, he checked on his extended family who lived near the site of the assault. But the incursion did not alter his position.
“My outlook hasn’t significantly changed. But something changed in the Israeli society. And in that sense, you could say we might be more distant politically.”
Netherlands-based Daniel Friedman, 44, was raised in South Africa by his father, Steven, an academic and vocal critic of Zionism, and his mother, who was part of a circle of anti-Apartheid activists.
While his father remains an anti-Zionist, Friedman said that he and his mother have increasingly been clashing over Israel’s genocide in Gaza since late 2023.
“This is really the only issue nowadays” affecting the conversations and bonds within some Jewish communities, he said.
One of their earlier arguments regarded the debunked claims that Palestinian fighters raped women during the October 7 incursion. After several uneasy disputes, often battled out by ping-ponging various newspaper links to support their arguments on WhatsApp, they have agreed to stop talking about politics.
“I love her, but what I struggle with is that I’ve lost a lot of trust for her,” said Friedman.
During a previous Israeli war on Gaza, his mother had signed a petition calling for a ceasefire, a move which saw her rejected by some family members. “I think that had quite a big effect,” he said. “She kind of went to the right.”
He said that he understands that for some, taking a stand means risking losing the support of a close community. He, however, chose to “cut a lot of people out of my life on purpose” after October 7, he said.
Back in Vienna, Sarig is busy organising a conference of Jewish anti-Zionists in June, featuring speakers such as Stephen Kapos, a UK-based Holocaust survivor, the American podcaster and commentator Katie Halper and Ronnie Barkan, a Jewish Israeli activist. Pappe too is expected to attend.
As the killings in Gaza continue, her focus, she said, is on the Palestinians trying to survive Israeli fire.
“I’m not the victim,” Sarig said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/14/in-some-jewish-families-speaking-up-for-palestine-causes-discontent

Middle East,Politics,Israeli attacks on Gaza kill 70 as ceasefire talks continue,"Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least 84 people, medical sources told Al Jazeera, as indirect ceasefire talks continue in Qatar.
At least 50 people were killed in Israeli attacks on northern Gaza, including in Jabalia refugee camp, since the early hours of Wednesday, according to medical sources.
Gaza’s Ministry of Health said almost 50 people were killed around Jabalia and 10 others in the southern city of Khan Younis.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
In Jabalia, rescue workers smashed through collapsed concrete slabs using hand tools, lit only by the light of cellphone cameras, to remove the bodies of some of the children who were killed.
Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said Israel was carrying out a “systematic and intensifying military aerial campaign”.
“[It’s] primarily targeting residential homes in order to force families to leave these areas and to move to live in makeshift tents, which will facilitate any plans to displace them out of northern Gaza,” he said.
“This has been a very dramatic reality and it underscores the severity of the humanitarian toll that children and displaced families in northern Gaza have been bearing over the course of the past week,” Abu Azzoum added.
The attacks come as an Israeli delegation was in Doha to continue indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas through the mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States, a day after the release of Israeli-American captive Edan Alexander during a short pause in Israel’s bombardment.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Tuesday that Israel would not end its military campaign in Gaza even if a ceasefire deal was reached.
Since October 2023, Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least 52,908 people, according to Gaza health authorities.
Israel’s assault has devastated much of Gaza’s urban landscape and displaced more than 90 percent of the population, often multiple times.
Israel launched its military campaign in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics.
International food security experts issued a stern warning earlier this week that Gaza will likely fall into famine if Israel doesn’t lift its blockade and stop its military assault.
French President Emmanuel Macron strongly denounced Netanyahu’s decision to block aid from entering Gaza as “a disgrace” that has caused a major humanitarian crisis.
“I say it forcefully, what Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is doing today is unacceptable,” Macron said on Tuesday evening on TF1 national television. “There’s no medicine. We can’t get the wounded out. Doctors can’t get in. What he’s doing is a disgrace. It’s a disgrace.”
Macron, who visited injured Palestinians in El Arish hospital in Egypt last month, called to reopen the Gaza border to humanitarian convoys. “Then, yes, we must fight to demilitarise Hamas, free the hostages and build a political solution,” he said.
But Netanyahu on Wednesday condemned the French leader’s comments.
“Macron has once again chosen to stand with a murderous Islamist terrorist organisation and echo its despicable propaganda, accusing Israel of blood libels,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office read.
Meanwhile, half a million Palestinians are facing possible starvation, living at “catastrophic” levels of hunger, while one million others can barely get enough food, according to findings by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a leading international authority on the severity of hunger crises.
Israel has banned all food, shelter, medicine and any other goods from entering the Palestinian territory for the past 10 weeks, even as it carries out waves of air strikes and ground operations.
Gaza’s population of about 2.3 million people relies almost entirely on outside aid to survive, because Israel’s 19-month-old military campaign has wiped out most capacity to produce food inside the territory.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/israeli-attacks-on-gaza-kill-70-as-ceasefire-talks-continue
Middle East,Politics,Trump meets Syria’s new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa,,https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/
Middle East,Politics,"Trump meets Syria’s al-Sharaa, eyes normalisation of ties with Damascus","United States President Donald Trump says Washington is considering the normalisation of ties with Damascus after he met Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa in the first such encounter between the two nations’ leaders in 25 years.
Trump made the announcement on Wednesday at a meeting with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) leaders in Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, during which he also said the US will drop “all sanctions” against Syria.
“With the support of the great leaders in this room, we are currently exploring normalising relations with Syria’s new government,” Trump said, confirming his brief meeting with al-Sharaa.
The “cessation of sanctions” will give Syria “a fresh start”, Trump said.
“We will be dropping all sanctions.”
Trump met al-Sharaa, who once pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda and swept to power in Syria at the head of a group of opposition fighters, before a summit between the United States and Gulf Arab countries.
Photos posted on Saudi state media showed them shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joined Trump and MBS virtually in the meeting, Turkiye’s Anadolu News Agency reported.
In a statement, the White House said that during the meeting, Trump asked al-Sharaa to deport Palestinians it described as “terrorists”, “sign onto the Abraham Accords with Israel” and “assume responsibility for ISIS detention centres in northeast Syria”.
On Tuesday night, Trump had announced he was lifting sanctions on the war-battered country, drawing praise from Arab leaders and celebrations in the streets across Syria.
Trump’s pledge to lift sanctions could be a major turning point for a country still adjusting to life after more than 50 years of iron-gripped rule by the al-Assad family.
Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December after a lightning offensive by opposition rebels led by al-Sharaa’s forces.
Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Riyadh, described Trump’s promise to lift all sanctions and his meeting with al-Sharaa as significant developments.
“This is a massive breakthrough, giving the new authorities in Syria more legitimacy internationally,” our correspondent said.
He said Trump’s decision would likely also pave the way for the GCC to commit more financial aid to the authorities in Syria, noting that US sanctions had previously held them back from investing.
Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Damascus, said the meeting between Trump and al-Sharaa, which lasted for 33 minutes, was a major diplomatic breakthrough.
“For the first time in 25 years, a Syrian president has met with an American president. That in itself is very historic.”
While ties between the US and Syria are at an “all-time high”, our correspondent said that it would be “very, very difficult” for Damascus to agree on Trump’s demand for Syria to sign on to the Abraham Accords with Israel.
Speaking with leaders of the Gulf nations on Wednesday, Trump also said that he hopes to “make a deal” with Iran that would prevent that country from developing a nuclear weapon, but insisted that Iran would have to cease support for a network of armed groups throughout the region.
In talks before the Gulf Cooperation Council, Trump said that Iran “must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons”.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is also the lead negotiator for a potential nuclear deal with the United States, slammed Trump’s remarks as a “very deceitful viewpoint”.
“What he stated about the hope of regional nations for a progressive, flourishing path, is the same path that people of Iran decided through their revolution,” Araghchi said.
“It was the US that blocked progress of Iranian nation through sanctions for more than 40 years as well as its pressures, military and nonmilitary threats,” he added.
The Iranian foreign ministry stated on Wednesday that Iran will hold new talks with European powers later this week over efforts to limit Iran’s ability to build a nuclear weapon. The talks will take place in Istanbul, the capital of Turkiye, with the “E3” nations of Britain, France, and Germany in attendance.
Later on Wednesday, Trump travelled to Qatar’s capital Doha where a state visit with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was under way.
Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US during the visit.
While the precise details of the investments Qatar plans to announce were unclear, Qatar Airways was expected to announce a deal to buy about 100 wide-body jets from Boeing, according to the Reuters news agency.
Trump’s first two days of a four-day swing through the Gulf region have been marked by lavish ceremonies and business deals, including a $600bn commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142bn in US arms sales to the kingdom.
Following his visit to Qatar, Trump will fly to Abu Dhabi to meet leaders from the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.

Middle East,Politics,Photos: Syrians celebrate US announcement on lifting sanctions,"Celebrations broke out across Syria after President Donald Trump said the United States would lift sanctions on the country.
The Syrian foreign ministry on Tuesday welcomed Trump’s announcement, calling it a “pivotal turning point for the Syrian people, as we seek to emerge from a long and painful chapter of war”.
“The removal of those sanctions offers a vital opportunity for Syria to pursue stability, self-sufficiency, and meaningful national reconstruction, led by and for the Syrian people,” it said in a statement.
In a speech given in Riyadh, the US president said he “will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness”.
US sanctions have isolated Syria from the global financial system and imposed a range of economic restrictions on the government over more than a decade of war in the country.
The lingering sanctions have widely been seen as a major obstacle to Syria’s economic recovery and post-war reconstruction.
Syrians met the news with joy and celebration, with dozens of men, women and children gathering in Damascus’s Umayyad Square. They blasted music while others drove by in their cars, waving Syrian flags.
“My joy is great, this decision will definitely affect the entire country positively. Construction will return, the displaced will return and prices will go down,” said Huda Qassar, a 33-year-old English language teacher, celebrating with her compatriots.
In the northern province of Idlib, Bassam al-Ahmed, 39, said he was very happy about the announcement.
“It is the right of the Syrian people, after 14 years of war and 50 years of the Assads’ oppression, to live through stability and safety,” he said.
Mazloum Abdi, also known as Mazloum Kobani, the leader of the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, welcomed the decision, saying he hopes it “will be invested in supporting stability and reconstruction, ensuring a better future for all Syrians”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/5/14/syrians-celebrate-us-announcement-on-lifting-sanctions

Middle East,Uncategorized,Photos: Israel attacks Gaza’s European Hospital,"Gaza rescuers said Israeli attacks close to the European Hospital killed at least 28 people, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the military would enter Gaza “with full force” in the coming days.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 28 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Tuesday around the hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
The rescue organisation said in a short statement that the bodies of some of the victims could not be recovered because they were “scattered around the hospital area” from the intensity of the Israeli bombardment.
After reports indicated a second round of Israeli missiles hit the area to deter rescue operations, the agency confirmed the Israeli army “deliberately targeted anyone who tried to reach” the wounded.
The Israeli military said it struck a “Hamas command centre” beneath the hospital, without providing any evidence.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Israeli military said it carried out “a targeted attack” on the Nasser Medical Complex, also in Khan Younis, killing two people, including Palestinian journalist Hassan Eslaih.
Gaza’s Government Media Office confirmed the killing of Eslaih, who was receiving treatment at the hospital’s burn unit for severe injuries sustained during an April 7 Israeli strike on a media tent located next to the hospital.
Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 52,908 Palestinians and wounded 119,721, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Government Media Office updated its death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of people missing under the rubble are presumed dead.
An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, and more than 200 others were taken captive.",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/5/14/israel-attacks-gazas-european-hospital
